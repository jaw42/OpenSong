 Every good and perfect gift
 Comes from You
 Every good and perfect gift
 Comes from You
 Every good and perfect gift
 Comes from You||
 Father of lights

[V1]
 Father of lights
 You delight in Your children
 Father of lights
 You delight in Your children

[V2]
 Father of lights You never change
 You have no turning
 Father of lights You never change
 You have no turning</lyrics></song>
