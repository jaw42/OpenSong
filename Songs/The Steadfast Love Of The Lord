  <lyrics>[C]
 The steadfast love
 Of the Lord never ceases
 Never ceases
 The steadfast love
 The steadfast love
 Of the Lord never ceases||
 His mercies never come to an end
 Never come to an end
 They are new ev'ry morning
 They are new ev'ry morning
 And great great
 Great is Thy faithfulness||
 Great is Thy faithfulness
 Great is Thy faithfulness
 Great great great</lyrics></song>
