  <lyrics>[V1]
.D               G          A       D
 Let Your living water flow over my soul.
.D             G               A       D
 Let Your Holy Spirit come and take control,
[V2]
.   D        G               A           D
 Of ev'ry situation that has troubled my mind.
.Bm               G            A     D 
 All my cares and burdens onto You I roll.
 
[C]
.D  G   D  A   Bm G A  D     G  A
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
.D  G    D  A   Bm  G A D    G  A
 Father, Father, Father.
.D  G    D  A    Bm G A D
 Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.
 
[V3]
 Come now Holy Spirit and take control.
 Hold me in Your loving arms and make me whole.
[V4]
 Wipe away all doubt and fear and take my pride.
 Draw me to Your love and keep me by Your side.
 
[V5]
 Give your life to Jesus, let Him fill your soul.
 Let Him take you in His arms and make you whole.
[V6]
 As you give your life to Him he'll set you free.
 You will live and reign with Him eternally.
