  <lyrics>[C]
 Give me an undivided heart
 That I may fear Your name
 Give me an undivided heart
 No other gods no other love
 No other gods before You

[V1]
 Teach me Your way oh Lord
 And I will walk in Your truth
 Show me Your paths oh Lord
 For I am devoted to You
 Purify my heart's desire
 I long to be Your servant||</lyrics></song>
