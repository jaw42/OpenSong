.D           G               D
 Come let us worship and bow down,
.       Em                                  A           
 Let us kneel before the Lord, our God, our Maker. 
.D           G               D
 Come let us worship and bow down,
.       Em                                  A           
 Let us kneel before the Lord, our God, our Maker.

.    G D       A     
 For He is our God,
.    G          Em            A         
 And we are the people of His pasture;
.        G    A       D    Bm
 And the sheep of His hand,
.         G    A       D      
 Just the sheep of His hand.</lyrics>
