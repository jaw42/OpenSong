.G                 D
 I'm giving You my heart 
.                C
 And all that is within
[V2]
.         D   Em  
 I lay it all down
.        D/F#           G
 For the sake of You my King
[V3]
.                  D
 I'm giving You my dreams
.                   C
 I'm laying down my rights
[V4]
.           D     Em
 I'm giving up my pride
.        D/F#           G
 For the promise of new life
 
[C1]
.    Em D/F#  G 
 And I surrender
.C   G/B G   Em     D  C
 All to You, all to You
[C2]
.    Em D/F#   G
 And I surrender
.C   G/B G   Em     D  C
 All to You, all to You
 
[V5]
 I'm singing You this song
 I'm waiting at the cross
[V6]
 And all the world holds dear
 I count it all as loss
[V7]
 For the sake of knowing You
 The glory of Your name
[V8]
 To know the lasting joy
 Even sharing in Your pain</lyrics></song>
