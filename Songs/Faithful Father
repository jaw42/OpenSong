  <lyrics>[C]
 This is my song of praise to You
 For who You are and all that You do
 From the moment my life began
 You have been faithful
 
[V1]
 Father I can't explain
 This kind of love
 This kind of grace
 I know I still break Your heart
 And yet You run to welcome me
 
[V2]
 Father I love the way
 You hold me close
 And say my name
 I know when my life is through
 My heart will find its home in You
 
[B]
 You will be faithful 
 Forever faithful
 My Father
 
[T]
 Forever faithful
