  <lyrics>[V1]
.F          G                Am
 Your light broke through my night
.  F                G
 Restored exceeding joy
[V2]
.F          G             Am
 Your grace fell like the rain
.    F                G
 And made this desert live
 
[C]
.           C  Am G                 F  Am  G
   You have turned my mourning into dancing
.           C  Am G               F G
   You have turned my sorrow into joy  X2
 
[V3]
 Your hand lifted me up
 I stand on higher ground
[V4]
 Your praise rose in my heart
 And made this valley sing
 
[T]
.  F              G    Am
   This is how we overcome</lyrics></song>
