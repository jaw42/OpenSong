  <lyrics>[C]
.             Bb   F
 Your Love is Deeper than any ocean.
.G#m  Eb                 Bb
 Higher than the heavens reaches;
.F                       Eb
 Beyond the stars in the sky.
.       G#m       F      Eb
 Jesus, Your Love has no bounds.

[V1]
.Bb                  F
 Jesus, Lord of Heaven,
.G#m             Eb
 I do not deserve
.     Bb                  F
 This grace that You have given
.        G#m           Eb
 And the promise of Your Word.

[V2]
.Bb                   F
 Lord I stand in wonder
.G#m                     Eb
 Of the sacrifice You made.
.    Bb                  F
 With mercy beyond measure,
.   G#m             Eb
 My debt You freely paid.</lyrics>
