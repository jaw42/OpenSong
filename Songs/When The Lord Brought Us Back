.D        A    G          D
 When the Lord brought us back
.G      D         G   A
 And restored our freedom,
[V2]
.   D       A       G       D
 We felt so good we felt so strong;
.   G        D               A   D
 At first we thought we were dreaming.
 
[V3]
 How we laughed! How we sang
 We were overflowing;
[V4]
 Then we heard the nations say
 'Look what the Lord has done'.
 
[C1]
.D                 G                D
 The Lord has done great things for us
.           A           D
 And we are filled with joy
[C2]
.    D             G            D
 The Lord has done great things for us
.D          A       
 And we are filled...
 
[T1]
.     D G D A
 With joy...
.     D G D A
 With joy...
[T2]
.     D G D A
 With joy...
.     D      G D A
 With joy</lyrics></song>
