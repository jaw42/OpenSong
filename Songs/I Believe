  <lyrics>[V1]
.    A          D              Bm  D/F#  G      
 I believe that I have the riches of heaven
.    A          D      Bm          D/F#         G
 I believe that I have found my purpose here on earth
[V2]
.    A          D          Bm     D/F#   G
 I believe that I know the God of my salvation
.    A          D            Bm      D/F#     G
 I believe that I'm going to be with Him for eternity
 
[C1]
.      D               A        G
 Cos I believe - Jesus died for me
.    D         A              G
 His blood was shed to set me free
[C2]
.         D        A        Em
 He rose again overcame the grave
.          C           A         D
 Now He's alive and my life He's saved
 
[V3]
 I believe that in You I am more than I could ever be
 I believe that I have a destiny of victory
[V4]
 I believe that I got Jesus and He's got me
 I believe that He has defeated the enemy</lyrics></song>
