  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em      C             G
 Cos I'm holding on to what I've found
.                      Em
 To what I've found in You
[V2]
.           C
 I'll never let go
.           G           D
 I'll never let go of You
 
[V3]
.Em             C              G 
 Cos You're the only one for a broken heart
.                        Em
 In You our heart's made new
[V4]
.           C
 I'll never let go
.           G             D
 I'll never let go of You
 
[C1]
.              C      G
 You sent Your own to die for me
.D                Em         D
 Paid the price instead of me
.C    G                    D     Em
 O my God it's a beautiful thing (repeat)
.Em   
 You're so beautiful
 
[T]
.C            D
 O my God, my heart is here for You
.    Em
 For You</lyrics></song>
