  <lyrics>[C]
 I see a cross
 And the price You had to pay
 I see the blood
 That washed my sins away
 And in the midst of a storm
 Thru the wind and the waves||
 You'll still be faithful
 You'll still be faithful
 When the stars refuse to shine
 And time is no more
 You'll still be faithful
 You'll still be faithful Lord

[V1]
 Like the sun that rises ev'ry day
 You are so faithful
 Lord You are faithful
 Like the rain that You send
 And ev'ry breath that I breathe
 You are so faithful Lord

[V2]
 Like a rose that comes alive ev'ry spring
 You are so faithful
 Lord You are faithful
 Like the life that You give
 To ev'ry beat of my heart
 You are so faithful Lord</lyrics>
