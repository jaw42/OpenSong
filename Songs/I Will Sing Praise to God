.G     D/F#      Em     C
 I  will sing praise to God
.G      D         C  G
 He has lifted me up
.G     D/F#     Em   C
 He heard my cry for help
.G      D         C    G
 And He filled my cup||
.D   C       G               
 His favor extends for a lifetime
.D   C              G             D
 His grace gives me strength each day
.G     D/F#       Em    C      
 My soul shall sing His praise
.G  D   C    G    
 Forevermore
