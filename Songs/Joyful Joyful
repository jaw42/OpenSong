.D               G              D             A
 Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love;
.D                  G                    D              A   D
 Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, opening to the sun above.
.A        D         A       D        A         D       G     A
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away;
.D        G                  D                A        D        
 Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!
[V2]
.D                  G                  D                  A
 All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,
.D                G                 D            A     D
 Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise.
.A         D       A        D         A       D       G        A
 Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea,
.D                G                D            A        D 
 Singing bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in Thee.
[V3]
.D               G              D              A
 Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed,
.D                 G                    D         A    D
 Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest!
.A        D       A          D        A       D       G        A
 Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are Thine;
.D               G                D              A    D 
 Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.
[V4]
.D                 G             D                 A
 Mortals, join the happy chorus, which the morning stars began;
.D              G                 D                  A      D
 Father love is reigning oâ€™er us, brother love binds man to man.
.A    D        A        D       A       D      G        A
 Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife,
.D            G                D              A       D 
 Joyful music leads us Sunward in the triumph song of life.</lyrics></song>
