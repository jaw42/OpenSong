  <lyrics>;Verse 1
[V1]
.        Bm   
 Did you rise the sun for me?
.   G
 Or paint a million stars 
.             D               D/C#
 That I might know Your majesty?
[V2]
.        Bm 
 Is Your voice upon the wind?
.   G    
 Is everything I've known marked 
.        D               D/C#
 With my Maker's fingerprints?
 
;Pre-Chorus
[P1]
.G          Bm 
 Breathe on me
.       A        D
 Let me see Your face
.G    A             D
 Ever I will seek You
 
;Chorus
[C1]
.D             D/C#         Bm      G        
 Cause all You are is all I want, always
.D/F#    A             Bm
 Draw me close in Your arms
.   G                    D    D/C#   Bm   G
 Oh God, I wanna be with You
 
;Verse 2
[V3]
 Can I feel You in the rain?
 Abandon all I am to have You
 Capture me again
[V4]
 Let the earth resound with praise
 Can you hear as all creation lives
 To glorify One name?
