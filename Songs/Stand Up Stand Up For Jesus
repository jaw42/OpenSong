  <lyrics>[V1]
 Stand up stand up for Jesus
 Ye soldiers of the cross
 Lift high His royal banner
 It must not suffer loss
 From vict'ry unto vict'ry
 His army shall He lead||
 Till ev'ry foe is vanquished
 And Christ is Lord indeed

[V2]
 Stand up stand up for Jesus
 The trumpet call obey
 Forth to the mighty conflict
 In this His glorious day
 Ye that are men now serve Him
 Against unnumbered foes||
 Let courage rise with danger
 And strength to strength oppose

[V3]
 Stand up stand up for Jesus
 Stand in His strength alone
 The arm of flesh will fail you
 Ye dare not trust your own
 Put on the Gospel armor
 Each piece put on with prayer||
 Where duty calls or danger
 Be never wanting there

[V4]
 Stand up stand up for Jesus
 The strife will not be long
 This day the noise of battle
 The next the victor's song
 To Him that overcometh
 A crown of life shall be||
 He with the King of Glory
 Shall reign eternally</lyrics></song>
