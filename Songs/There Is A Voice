.A                     Asus4
 There is a voice that must be heard
.A                    Asus4
 There is a song that must be sung
.F#m                  D              E
 There is a name that must be lifted high
[V2]
.A                  Asus4
 There is a treasure more than gold
.A               Asus4
 There is a King upon the throne
.F#m                D                    E
 There is one whose praise will fill the skies
 
[C1]
.              A  Asus4         A   Asus4
   His name is Jesus, friend of sinners
.         A  Asus4         F#m  E  D
   Jesus, Jesus, friend of mine
 
[V3]
 There is a peace that calms our fears
 There is a love stronger than death
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave
[V4]
 There is a friend who won't let go
 There is a heart that beats for you
 There is one name by which we are saved
 
[B]
.  Bm         E             Bm
   When I was captive to my fears
.               E               Bm  E
   You were the one who came to me
.             F#m  E  D, F#m  E  D, F#m E  D
   You set me free</lyrics></song>
