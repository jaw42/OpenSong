  <lyrics>[C]
 Hide me in the shelter
 Of Your love
 Deep in the center
 Of Your heart my Lord
 How I want to know You more
 And keep me in the shadow||
 Of Your wings
 Safe in the secret place
 Of holiness
 How I need You more and more
 (And more and more)

[V1]
 Under the shadow
 Of Your wings
 Here in the secret place
 Of Your holiness
 I will wait on You
 O Lord my God and King||
 Here in the Holiest of All
 You draw me near with love
 To abandon all
 For the sake of knowing You
 My God and King

[V2]
 Here in the Holiest of All
 You draw me near with love
 To abandon all for the sake
 Of knowing You
 My God and King

[T]
 Hide me
 And keep me O Lord
 Safe in the secret place
 Safe in the secret place</lyrics></song>
