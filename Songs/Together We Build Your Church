 From Him we build and grow,
 Empowered by His love

 Let’s lift up one another, in love and unity
 Let’s encourage each other to serve God faithfully
 Lord, we look to You
 For You are the One and Only Truth 
 Lord, we look to You
 For You are the One and Only Truth

[T]
 Let us be Your hands, let us be Your feet
 Together we will build Your church
 Let us be Your light, let us be Your voice
 Together we will build Your church
