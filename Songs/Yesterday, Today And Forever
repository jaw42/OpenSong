.G              Bm7 
 Everlasting God
.    G                    Bm7 
 The years go by but You're unchanging
.G                     Bm7 
 In this fragile world,
.    G               Bm7 
 You are the only firm foundation
 
.Em7                 D/F# 
 Always loving, Always true
.G                        Bm7      A 
 Always merciful, and good, so good
 
[C1]
.D/F#  D/G      Bm       A

.D/F#         G    Bm          A 
 You are the same, You never change
 
[C2]
.D/F#  D/G      Bm       A 
 Yesterday, Today and Forever
.Em7               D/G           A         D/F#D/G  
 You are faithful, and we will trust in You
 
[V2]
 Uncreated one,
 You have no end and no beginning;
 Earthly powers fade,
 But there is no end to Your kingdom;
 Always loving, Always true,
 Always merciful and good, so good.
