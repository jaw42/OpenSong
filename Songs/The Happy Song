  <lyrics>[C]
 Oh I could sing unending songs
 Of how You saved my soul
 Well I could dance a thousand miles
 Because of Your great love

[V1]
 My heart is bursting Lord
 To tell of all You've done
 Of how You changed my life
 And wiped away the past
 I wanna shout it out
 From every rooftop sing||
 For now I know that God
 Is for me not against me

[B]
 Everybody's singing now
 'Cause we're so happy
 Everybody's dancing now
 'Cause we're so happy
 If only we could see Your face
 And see You smiling over us||
 And unseen angels celebrate
 For joy is in this place</lyrics></song>
