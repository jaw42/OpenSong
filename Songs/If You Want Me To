  <lyrics>[V1]
 The pathway is broken
 And the signs are unclear
 And I don't know the reason
 Why You brought me here
 But just because You love me
 The way that You do
 I'm gonna walk through the valley
 If You want me to
 
[V2]
 No I'm not who I was
 When I took my first step
 And I'm clingin' to the promise
 You're not through with me yet
 So if all of these trials
 Bring me closer to You
 Then I will go through the fire
 If You want me to
 
[V3]
 It may not be the way I would have chosen
 When You lead me through a world
 That's not my home
 But You never said it would be easy
 You only said I'll never go alone
 
[V4]
 So when the whole world turns against me
 And I'm all by myself
 And I can't hear You answer my cries for help
 I'll remember the suff'ring
 That Your love put You through
 And I will walk through the darkness
 If You want me to
 
[V5]
 'Cause when I cross over Jordan
 I'm gonna sing, gonna shout
 I'm gonna look into Your eyes and see
 You never let me down
 So take me on the pathway that leads me home to You
 and I will walk through the valley
 If You want me to</lyrics>
