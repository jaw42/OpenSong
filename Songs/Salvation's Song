  <lyrics>[V1]
 LOVED BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME,
 Chosen by my Maker,
 Hidden in my Saviour:
 I am His and He is mine,
 Cherished for eternity.
 
[V2]
 When I'm stained with guilt and sin,
 He is there to lift me,
 Heal me and forgive me;
 Gives me strength to stand again,
 Stronger than I was before.
 
[C]
 So with every breath that I am given
 I will sing salvation's song;
 And I'll join the chorus of creation
 Giving praise to Christ alone.
 
[V3]
 All the chains of Satan's curse
 Lifted through His offering,
 Satisfied through suffering;
 All the blessings He deserves
 Poured on my unworthy soul.
 
[B]
 Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
 To the Lamb upon the throne.
 Hallelujah, I will lift Him high.||
 Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
 To the Lamb upon the throne.
 Hallelujah I will sing with every breath that I am given
 I will sing salvation's song;
 And I'll join the chorus of creation
 Giving praise to Christ alone.
 
[V4]
 Stars will fade and mountains fall;
 Christ will shine forever,
 Love's unfading splendour.
 Earth and heaven will bow in awe,
 Joining in salvation's song.</lyrics></song>
