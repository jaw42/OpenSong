.G              D/F#
 Here I am once again
.  Em
 I pour out my heart
[V2]
.      C                        G
 For I know that you hear every cry
.        D/F#
 You are listening
.   Em                C
 No matter what state my heart is in
 
[V3]
 You are faithful to answer
 With words that are true
 And a hope that is real
[V4]
 As I feel your touch
 You bring a freedom to all that's within
 
[T]
.       Am     G/B     C
 In the safety of this place
.    D
 I'm longing to ...
 
[C1]
.G                     D/F#
 Pour out my heart, to say that I love you
.Em                    C
 Pour out my heart, to say that I need you
[C2]
.G                     D/F#
 Pour out my heart, to say that I'm thankful
.Em                    C                   G
 Pour out my heart, to say that you're wonderful</lyrics></song>
