.   A7sus  D
1O Church, arise
2Our call to war
3Come see the cross
4So Spirit, come
 
.            G/B
1And put your armor on,
2To love the captive soul,
3Where love and mercy meet,
4Put strength in every stride,
 
.      D/F#        G       Asus A    D
1Hear the call of Christ, our Cap_____tain;
2But to rage against the cap_____tor.
3As the Son of God is strick_____en.
4Give grace for every   hur_____dle.
 
.    A7sus        D
1For now the weak
2And with the sword
3Then see His foes
4That we may run
 
.       G/B        A/C#
1can say that they are strong,
2that makes the wounded whole,
3lie crushed beneath His feet,
4with faith to win the prize,
 
.         D/F#        G   Asus  A   D
1In the strength that God has giv____en.||
2We will fight and faith and va_____lor.||
3For the Conquer_____or has ris_____en.||
4Of a servant good   and  faith____ful.||
 
.        D/F#      G
1With shield of faith
2When faced with trials
3And as the stone
4As saints of old
 
.       D/F#    A
1And belt of truth
2On   every    side
3Is rolled away
4Still line the way
 
.     D/F#    G          D/F#    Bm  A
1We’ll stand against the dev_____il’s lies;
2We know the outcome is        se_____ure;
3And Christ emerges from   the   grave;
4Retelling triumphs of         His   grace;
 
.   A7sus    D
1An army bold,
2And Christ will have,
3This victory march,
4We hear their calls,
 
.                   G/B    A/C#
1Whose battle cry is love,
2The prize for which He died,
3Continues till the day,
4And hunger for the day,
 
.  D/F#     G        Asus  A  D    Dsus    D
1Reaching out to those in dark_____ness.
2And in___heri___tance of na_____tions.
3Every eye and heart shall see     Him
4When with Christ we stand in glo____ ry
