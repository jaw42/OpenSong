.A                        D
 These are the days of Elijah
.  A           E           A
 Declaring the word of the Lord
.    A                          D
 And these are the days of Your servant Moses
[V2]
.A             E       A
 Righteousness being restored
.    C#m                            F#m
 And though these are days of great trial
.   B          A            E
 Of famine and darkness and sword
[V3]
.      A                       D
 Still we are the voice in the desert, crying
.    A           E          A
 'Prepare Ye the way of the Lord'
 
[C1]
.          A                    D
 Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
.                 A                   E
 Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call
[C2]
.          A                       D
 Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
.              A        E      A
 Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes
 
[V4]
 These are the days of Ezekiel
 The dry bones becoming as flesh
 And these are the days of Your servant, David
[V5]
 Rebuilding the temple of praise
 These are the days of the harvest
 The fields are as white in the world
[V6]
 And we are the labourers in the vineyard
 Declaring the word of the Lord
 
[T]
 There's no God like Jehovah</lyrics></song>
