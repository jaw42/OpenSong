  <lyrics>[C1]
.  G               D
 We look to You, O God
.   Em              C
 To heal our broken nations
.   G             D
 We revel in Your love
[C2]
.       Em              C
 And we bow before Your throne
.     G                 D
 Just touch us Lord, we pray
.       Em           C
 Let us never be the same
[C3]
.       G               D
 Just ignite the fire again
.        Em           C                G C D
 Lord we give you everything...everything
 
[V1]
.C                G
 Lord we long for You
.         Em               D
 And we're hungry for Your blessing
.      C                G
 We're waiting for Your truth
[V2]
.   Em                D
 To sweep across this land
.      C                G
 We're craving for Your touch
.   Em            D
 To pour upon the nations
[V3]
.      C               G
 We're asking for Your love

 To dwell in us always...always

 Lord we wait for You
 To see all of Your glory
 Let this whole world see

 The power of Your love
 We thank you Lord, our God
 For the gift of our salvation
[V6]
 Forever we will praise
 And serve you Lord always...always</lyrics></song>
