.E          B       C#m          A               E
 Stir in me, a fire that the world cannot explain
.B             C#m     A
 I come to worship You.||
.E          B       C#m            A              E
 Stir in me, a passion that my heart cannot contain.
.B             C#m     A
 I come to worship You.

.E          B        C#m         A                E         B
 Hold me, break me, mold me and make me |more and more like You,
.         C#m      A
 I come to worship You.||
.E         B         C#m       A              E          B
 To love You, fear You, draw ever near You |as I worship You,
.          C#m     A       E
 I come to worship You, oh Lord.</lyrics>
