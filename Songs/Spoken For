  <lyrics>[C]
 Covered by a love divine
 Child of the risen Lord
 To hear You say this one's Mine
 My heart is spoken for

[V1]
 Take this world from me
 I don't need it anymore
 For I am fin'lly free
 My heart is spoken for
 Oh and I praise You
 Oh and I worship You||

[V2]
 Now I have a peace
 That I've never known before
 I find myself complete
 My heart is spoken for
 Oh and I praise You
 Oh and I worship You||

[B]
 By the power of the cross
 You've taken what was lost
 And made it fully Yours
 And I have been redeemed
 By You who spoke to me
 Now I am spoken for||

[T]
 Take this world from me
 I don't need it anymore</lyrics></song>
