[V2]
 O come thou Wisdom from on high
 And order all things far and nigh
 To us the path of knowledge show
 And cause us in her ways to go||

[V3]
 O come O come great Lord of might
 Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
 In ancient times once gave the law
 In cloud and majesty and awe||

[V4]
 O come thou Root of Jesse's tree
 An ensign of Thy people be
 Before Thee rulers silent fall
 All peoples on Thy mercy call||

[V5]
 O come thou Key of David come
 And open wide our heavenly home
 Make safe the way that leads on high
 And close the path to misery||
---

[V6]
 O come thou Dayspring come and cheer
 Our spirits by Thy justice here
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
 And death's dark shadows put to flight||

[V7]
 O come Desire of nations bind
 All peoples in one heart and mind
 From dust Thou brought us forth to life
 Deliver us from earthly strife||

[V8]
 O come Thou Rod of Jesse free
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny
 From depths of hell Thy people save
 And give them victory o'er the grave||</lyrics>
