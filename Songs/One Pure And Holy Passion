  <lyrics>[C]
 Give me one pure and holy passion
 Give me one magnificent obsession
 Jesus give me one glorious ambition for my life
 To know and follow hard after You||
 To know and follow hard after You
 To grow as Your disciple in the truth
 This world is empty pale and poor
 Compared to knowing You my Lord||
 Lead me on and I will run after You
 Lead me on and I will run after You
 Lead me on and I will run after You</lyrics>
