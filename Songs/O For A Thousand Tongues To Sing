.  D     A        D/F#    A7 D
 O for a thousand tongues to sing
.A  D       G        A
 My great Redeemer's praise

 The glories of my God and King
.    D        A      D
 The triumphs of His grace
 
[V2]
.   D        A      D/F#  A7 D
 My gracious Master and   my God
.A D       G     A
 Assist me to proclaim
.   D                      G
 To spread through all the earth abroad
.    D      A      D
 The honors of Thy name
 
[V3]
.  D       A         D/F#   A7  D
 Jesus the name that charms our fears
.A    D        G       A
 That bids our sorrows cease
.     D            G
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears
.     D        A          D       B (key change)
 'Tis life and health and peace

[V4]
.   E          B        E/G# B7    E
 He breaks the power of can__celed sin
.B  E        A        B
 He sets the prisoner free
.    E                  A
 His blood can make the foulest clean
.    E     B           E
 His blood availed for me
 
[V5]
.     E      B        E/G#   B7 E
 Hear Him ye deaf His praise ye dumb
.B    E        A       B
 Your loosened tongues employ
.   E                 A
 Ye blind behold your Savior come
.    E       B        E
 And leap ye lame for joy
 
[V6]
 Glory to God and praise and love
 Be ever ever giv'n
 By saints below and saints above
 The church in earth and heav'n</lyrics>
