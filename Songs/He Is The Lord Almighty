.D              C                 B             D
 He - calms the waves, fills the seas - Rescues me
.D                           C                          B               D
 He - who throw stars in the skies, told the sun when to rise - He holds me
.D                          C                     B                D
 He - came from heaven into skin, to deal with my sin - He rescues me
.D            C                 B                    D
 He - full of love, consumed by light - He's holding me
 
[c]
.              D         A
 He is the Lord Almighty
.           G   D
 God of eternity
.            D     A
 God of everlasting
.         G            D
 He lives, He lives in me
 
[v2]
 He - blesses the poor, all of heaven - it's all theirs
 He - heals the brokenhearted, and has set the whole word free
 He speaks - and there is life, and He sings love songs over me
 He's the great "I am", Son of God and Son of Man

 He lives in me, He lives in me
.            G               D
 He lives in me, He lives in me</lyrics></song>
