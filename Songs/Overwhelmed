[C]
 Your blood of redemption
 Is covering my shame
 (Is covering my shame)
 Your voice that shakes the heavens
 Is whispering my name
 (Is whispering my name)
 As You catch my tears with Your nail-scarred hand
 I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed with You
 I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed with You

[V1]
 I am nothing yet You bid me
 Come to You oh Lord Almighty
 As I come I'm overwhelmed with You
 Humbly now I break the silence
 As I'm weeping in Your presence
 I'm so wretched overwhelmed with You

[T]
 I am nothing yet You bid me
 Come to You oh Lord Almighty</lyrics></song>
