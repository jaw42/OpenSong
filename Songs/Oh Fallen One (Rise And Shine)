.Em       D/F# G 
 Oh fallen One covered now in shame
.Em        D/F#              G
 He is your hope, He is your life
[V2]
.Em              D/F#        G
 Though He should judge, His anger turns away
.Em           D/F#            C
 Rise from the dust beautiful One
 
[V3]
 Don't be afraid for you're not left alone
 His heart of love is broken for you
[V4]
 Your Father cares for all your children now
 Arise in His name beautiful one
 
[C1]
. C         D  B/G     C         D   B/G 
 Arise and shine, your glory has come
. C         D  B/G     C         D   B/G 
 Arise and shine, your glory has come
[C2]
. Am       Em           C              D
 Arise and shine, He is calling you by name
.            Am                Em   
 Though your walls have fallen down
.                C
 He'll build you up again
 
[V5]
 Lift up your eyes, many come to see
 The splendour your God has given to you
[V6]
 Could each of your saints become a thousand saints?
 Rise up and praise beautiful one
 
[B1]
.D/F#   Em      C      D
 So let Your salvation come
.D/F#     Em    C    
 For Your glory Lord
[B2]
.D/F#    Em       C       D
 Set the captives free we pray
.     D/F#       Em     C
 These souls are Your reward</lyrics></song>
