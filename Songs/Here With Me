  <lyrics>[C]
 I can feel Your presence here with me
 Suddenly I'm lost within Your beauty
 Caught up in the wonder of Your touch
 Here in this moment I surrender to Your love

[V1]
 You're everywhere I go
 I am not alone
 You call me as Your own
 To know You and be known
 You are holy
 I fall down to my knees||
 I surrender to Your grace
 I surrender to the one who took my place

[V2]
 I long for Your embrace
 Every single day
 To meet You in this place
 To see You face to face
 Will You show me
 Reveal yourself to me||
 Because of Your mercy
 I fall down on my knees</lyrics></song>
