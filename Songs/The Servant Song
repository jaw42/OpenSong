  <lyrics>[V1]
 Brother let me be your servant
 Let me be as Christ to you
 Pray that I might have the grace
 To let you be my servant too

[V2]
 We are pilgrims on a journey
 We are brothers on the road
 We are here to help each other
 Walk the mile and bear the load

[V3]
 I will hold the Christ-light for you
 In the night time of your fear
 I will hold my hand out to you
 Speak the peace you long to hear

[V4]
 I will weep when you are weeping
 When you laugh I'll laugh with you
 I will share your joy and sorrow
 Till we've seen this journey through

[V5]
 When we sing to God in heaven
 We shall find such harmony
 Born of all we've know together
 Of Christ's love and agony

[V6]
 Brother sister let me serve you
 Let me be as Christ to you
 Pray that I may have the grace
 To let you be my servant too</lyrics></song>
