[V2]
 Jesus loves me when I'm good
 When I do the things I should
 Jesus loves me when I'm bad
 Though it makes Him very sad

[V3]
 Jesus loves me loves me still
 Tho' I'm very weak and ill
 That I might from sin be free
 Bled and died upon the tree

[V4]
 Jesus loves me he who died
 Heaven's gate to open wide
 He will wash away my sin
 Let His little child come in

[V5]
 Jesus loves me He will stay
 Close beside me all the way
 Thou hast bled and died for me
 I will henceforth live for Thee

[V6]
 Jesus loves the children dear
 Children far away or near
 They are safe when in His care
 Ev'ry day and ev'rywhere

[V7]
 Jesus take this heart of mine
 Make it pure and wholly Thine
 Thou has bled and died for me
 I will henceforth live for Thee</lyrics></song>
