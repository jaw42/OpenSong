[V1]
.            E             B
 Lord You're calling me to come
.      F#m               A
 And behold the wondrous cross
.     E                   B
 To explore the depths of grace
.             F#m          A
 That came to me at such a cost
.           E         B
 Where Your boundless love
.             F#m9      A
 Conquered my boundless sin
.    C#m     G#               A   A
 And mercy's arms were opened wide

 My heart is filled with a thousand songs

 Proclaiming the glories of Calvary

 With every breath

 Lord how I long to sing of Jesus

 Who died for me

[V2]
.        E            B
 Sinners find eternal joy
.       F#m             A
 In the triumph of Your wounds
.       E                B
 By our Savior's crimson flow
.     F#m              A
 Holy wrath has been removed
.         E        B
 And Your saints below join
.          F#m9    A
 With Your saints above
.  C#m     G#           A   A
 Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb</lyrics></song>
