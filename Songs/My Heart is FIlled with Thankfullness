  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                       Am      F
 My heart is filled with thankfulness
.C          Am      F
 To Him who bore my pain
.G   C                     Am      F
 Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
.C           G    C
 And gave me life again
.    Am         G        F  G  Am
 Who crushed my curse of sinfulness
.    F          C      G
 And clothed me in His light
.    C                A        F
 And wrote His law of righteousness
.     C      G      C
 With power upon my heart.
 
[V2]
.C                       Am      F
 My heart is filled with thankfulness
.C          Am      F
 To Him who walks beside
.C                       Am      F
 Who floods my weaknesses and strengths
.C           G    C
 And causes fear to fly
.      Am    G       F  G  Am
 Whose every promise is enough
.    F     C      G
 For every step I take
.    C              A       F
 Sustaining me with arms of love
.     C       G       C
 And crowning me with grace
 
[V3]
.C                       Am      F
 My heart is filled with thankfulness
.C          Am      F
 To Him who reigns above;
.C                       Am      F
 Whose wisdom is my perfect peace;
.C           G          C
 Whose every thought is love.
.      Am    G   F    G  Am
 For every day I have on earth
.    F     C      G
 Is given by the  King.
.   C              A       F
 So I will give my life, my all,
.     C       G       C
 To love and follow Him.
