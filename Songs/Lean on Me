.E                A
 Sometimes in our lives
.            E
 we all have pain
.            G#m  B
 We all have sorrow
.E                A
 But if we are wise
.             E              B      E
 We know that there's always tomorrow

[C]
.E                           A
 Lean on me, when you're not strong
.                 E
 And I'll be your friend
.              G#m   B
 I'll help you carry on
.E               A
 For it won't be long
.               E
 'Til I'm gonna need
.            B    E
 Somebody to lean on
---
[V2]
.E                   A
 Please swallow your pride
.          E
 If I have things
.            G#m  B
 you need to borrow
.E              A
 For no one can fill
.              E
 those of your needs
.               B   E
 That you don't let show

[V3]
.E             A
 If there is a load
.            E
 you have to bear
.               G#m B
 That you can't carry
.E                A
 I'm right up the road
.                E
 I'll share your load
.            B    E
 If you just call me


[T]
.E                                    B      E
 So just call on me brother, when you need a hand
.E                       B    E
 We all need somebody to lean on
.E                                B          E
 I just might have a problem that you'd understand
.E                       B    E
 We all need somebody to lean on</lyrics></song>
