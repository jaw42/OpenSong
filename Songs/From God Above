[V1]
.Em   C           A         D      Em
 As I look at the world I begin to dream

 Of the future, what’s next to be
[V2]

 Your love so strong for everyone
.    C       A                  C 
 You made us all in Your image
 
[B1]
.        Em
 And You saved the day
.     G 
 When Jesus came
[B2]
.        C 
 And You took away all my sin and shame
.        Em             A 
 And You made us right again

 You came from God above
