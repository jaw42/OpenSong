  <lyrics>[V1]
 Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise
 Then walk away and forget Your Name
 I'll stand for You if its all I do
[V2]
 Cause there is none that compares to You
 Cause all I want in this lifetime is You
 And all I want in this whole world is You
 
[C1]
.A                   E    
 Tell the world that Jesus lives
.F#m                  D
 Tell the world that, tell the world that
[C2]
.A                      E
 Tell the world that He died for them
.F#m                    D
 Tell the world that He lives again
 
[V3]
 No longer I but Christ in me
 Cause it's the truth that set me free
[V4]
 How could this world be a better place?
 But by Your mercy, by Your grace
[V5]
 Cause all i want in this lifetime is You
 And all I want in this whole world is You
 
[B]

 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
.  A                Bm                   F#m  D
 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You</lyrics></song>
