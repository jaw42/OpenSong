  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                 C        G
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.  D/F#       Em        A     D
 On which the Prince of Glory died
[V2]
.           G                Em
 My richest gain I count but loss
.         G           D      G
 And pour contempt on all my pride
 
[V3]
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
 Save in the death of Christ, my God
[V4]
 All the vain things that charm me most
 I sacrifice them to his blood
 
[V5]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down
[V6]
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown
 
[V7]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
 That were an off'ring far too small
[V8]
 Love so amazing, so divine
 Demands my soul, my life, my all</lyrics></song>
