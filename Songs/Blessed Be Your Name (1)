.A       E                     F#m           D
1Blessed be Your name |in the   land that is  plentiful,
2And blessed be Your name |when I'm found in the desert place,
3Blessed be Your name |when the sun's shining down on me,
4And blessed be Your name |on the   road marked with suffering,

.           A               E              F#m                  D
1Where Your streams of a____bundance flow, blessed be Your name.
2Though I       walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name.
3When the   world's "all as it should be," |blessed be Your name.
4Though there's pain in the      offering,   blessed be Your name.


[P]
.A              E                 F#m          D
 Every blessing You pour out |I'll turn back to praise,
.A                     E                F#m          D
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say...


[C]
.               A           E                     F#m  D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name.
.               A           E                     F#m E    D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your glorious name.


[T]
.    A              E        F#m            D
 You give and take away. You give and take away.
.   A                    E          F#m             D
 My heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be Your name.</lyrics>
