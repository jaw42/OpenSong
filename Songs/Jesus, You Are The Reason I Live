    Jesus, You are the reason I live
 
[V1]
.       G            D                      Em
 When I think of the things You've done for me

 I know You are the reason I live
[V2]

 And I want to know You more each day

 God please open my eyes and show me Your way

. Em                   C
  You are the reason I live in this world
. G                 D
  You are the one I want to be like
[B2]
. Em                   C
  You are the reason I live in this world

  Show me the way to live
. A         C       G
  I want to be like You

 I'll always go Your way
 And that will never change
 You will be the one for all of my days</lyrics></song>
