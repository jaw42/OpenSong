  <lyrics>;Verse 1
[V1]
.      Em 
 As we come today 
.     D/F#              G
 We remind ourselves of what we do
[V2]
.           Em                 D/F#
 That these songs are not just songs, 
.             C
 But signs of love for You
 
[V3]
.          Em   D/F#   G
 This is a holy moment now
.             Em     D/F#    G
 Something of heaven touches earth
[V4]
.          Em     D/F#  G
 Voices of angels all resound
.              A
 We join their song
 
;Chorus
[C1]
.Em          D/F#
 Come, come, come
.       G       A
 Let us worship God
[C2]
.         Em         D/F#
 With our hands held high
.        C
 And our hearts bowed down
[C3]
.        Em        D/F#
 We will run, run, run
.             G        A
 Through Your gates, O God
[C4]
.       Em       D/F#
 With a shout of love
.       C
 With a shout of love
 
;Verse 2
[V5]
 Lord with confidence
 We come before Your throne of grace
[V6]
 Not that we deserve to come
 But You have paid the way
[V7]
 You are the holy King of all
 Heaven and earth are in Your hands
[V8]
 All of the angels sing Your song
 We join them now
 
;Bridge 
[B]
.              Em   D/F#   G
 Let this be a holy moment now</lyrics></song>
