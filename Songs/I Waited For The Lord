[C]
.  G  Am C D
 I waited
.        G       Am C D
 for the Lord on high
.  G  Am C
 I waited
.       D        G  Am  C  D
 and He heard my cry

[C2]
.  G  Am C D
 I waited
.        G       Am C D
 for the Lord on high
.  G  Am C
 I waited
.       D        G  Am  C  D
 and He heard my cry

[V1]
.   Em                  G
 He pulled me out of my despair
.   Em                 C
 He showed me where to walk
.     Em              G
 From fear into security
.     Em             C D
 From quicksand to a rock

[V2]
 There's a new song in my heart to sing
 A new song praises to my King
 There's a new song in my heart to sing
 A new song praises to my King

[V3]
 I'll sing to let the people know
 That I have been restored
 And they will kneel and understand
 To return and trust in the Lord
