  <lyrics>[C]
 And I cry holy, holy, holy God
 How awesome is Your name
 Holy holy holy God
 How majestic is Your reign
 And I am changed
 In the presence of a holy God
 
[V1]
 In the presence of a holy God
 There's new meaning now to grace
 You took all my sins upon Yourself
 I can only stand amazed
 
[V2]
 In the presence of Your infinite might
 I'm so small and frail and weak
 When I see Your pow'r and wisdom Lord
 I have no words left to speak
 
[V3]
 In the presence of Your glory
 All my crowns lie in the dust
 You are righteous in Your judgments Lord
 You are faithful true and just</lyrics>
