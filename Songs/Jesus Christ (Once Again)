.D               G               D
 Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
.Em         D        G             A
 You became nothing, poured out to death.
.D               G                D
 Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life,
[V2]
.    Em          A          D
 And I'm in that place once again,
.Em          A          D
 I'm in that place once again.
 
[C]
.D                G
 And once again I look upon
.    D               A
 The cross where You died:
.    D               G
 I'm humbled by your mercy
[D]
.        D       A
 And I'm broken inside.
.Bm           G
 Once again I thank You,
.D            A           G   A
 Once again I pour out my life.
 
[V3]
 Now You are exalted to the highest place,
 King of the heavens - where one day I'll bow,
 But for now, I marvel at this saving grace,
[V4]
 And I'm full of praise once again.
 I'm full of praise once again.</lyrics></song>
