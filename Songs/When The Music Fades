.D              A
 When the music fades
.                Em
 All is stripped away
.             A    D
 And I simply come
[V2]
.                A        
 Longing just to bring
.                    Em
 Something that's of worth
.                     A
 That will bless Your heart
 
[B1]
.Em             D           A
 I'll bring You more than a song
.                   Em
 For a song in itself
.            D          A     
 Is not what You have required
[B2]
.Em              D        A
 You search much deeper within
.                           Em
 Through the way things appear
.               D       A
 You're looking into my heart
 
[C1]
.D                      A
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.         Em
 And it's all about You
.G         A      D
 All about You, Jesus
[C2]
.                       A
 I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
.          Em
 When it's all about You
.G         A       D
 All about You, Jesus
 
[V3]
 King of endless worth
 No one could express
 How much You deserve
[V4]
 Though I'm weak and poor
 All I have is Yours
 Every single breath</lyrics></song>
