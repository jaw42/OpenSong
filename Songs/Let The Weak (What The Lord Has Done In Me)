  <lyrics>[V1]
.        C        G    C
 Let the weak say I am strong
.        F             Am
 Let the poor say I am rich
[V2]
.        C         G     C
 Let the blind say I can see
.              Dm       G       C
 It's what the Lord has done in me
 
[C1]
.  G        Am
 Hosanna, Hosanna
.       F             C
 To the Lamb that was slain
.  G        Am
[C2]
 Hosanna, Hosanna
.      C        G    C
 Jesus died and rose again
 
[V3]
 Into the river I will wade
 Where my sins are washed away
[V4]
 From the heavens mercy streams
 Of the Saviour's love for me
 
[V5]
 I will rise from waters deep
 Into the Saviour's arms of love
[V6]
 I will sing salvation's song
 Jesus Christ has set me free</lyrics></song>
