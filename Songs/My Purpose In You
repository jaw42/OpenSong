  <lyrics>[V1]
 I'm coming back to You
 I'm searching for Your truth
 Lord, I'm seeking You
 
[V2]
 My pride needs to break
 My life is Yours to take
 Lord I'm seeking You
 
[C]
 I yearn to know Your purpose for me
 May my heart hear Your voice calling me
 To lay down my world, to give You my heart
 To carry out Your purpose for me.
 
[B]
 Here I am
 All of me
 May all that I do 
 Be pleasing to You||
 Here I am
 All of me
 In all that I do 
 May I honor You
