  <lyrics>[C]
 I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed
 Bought with a price
 And ransomed from my sin||
 You rescued me, You rescued me
 Bought with Your blood
 And held in Your holy hands||
 I've been redeemed
 You rescued me
 
[V1]
 Whiter than snow
 You have made me
 Holy in the Father's eyes||
 You see in me the child
 You died for
 You see in me the one You love</lyrics>
