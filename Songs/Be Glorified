  <lyrics>[C]
 You set my feet to dancing
 You set my heart on fire
 In the presence of a thousand kings
 You are my one desire
 And I stand before You now
 With trembling hands lifted high||
 Be glorified

[V1]
 Your love has captured me
 Your grace has set me free
 Your life the air I breathe
 Be glorified in me

[T]
 Be glorified in me
 Be glorified in me
 Be glorified in me
 Be glorified</lyrics></song>
