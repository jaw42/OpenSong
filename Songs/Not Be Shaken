  <lyrics>[C]
 When the nations crumble
 The word of the Lord will stand
 Kings may rise and fall
 But His love will endure
 Though the strong may stumble
 The joy of the Lord is strength||
 To my soul
 I will not be shaken
 I will not be moved
 I will not be shaken
 
[V1]
 I will declare my choice to the nations
 And I will shout for joy in the congregation
 I will worship God
 (Worship God)
 All my days
 
[V2]
 Those who love the Lord are satisfied
 Those who trust in Him are justified
 And I will serve my God
 (Serve my God)
 All my days</lyrics>
