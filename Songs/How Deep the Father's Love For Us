.
1How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure,
2Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders,
3I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom, 
.
1That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure;||
2Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers;||
3But I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection;||
.
1How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away,
2It was my sin that held him there, until it was accomplished,
3Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer,
.
1As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
2His dying breath has brought me life, I know that it is finished.
3But this I know with all my heart, his wounds have paid my ransom.
