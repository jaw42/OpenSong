.Em   D C  C/B                  C     
 Here I am humbled by Your majesty

 Covered by Your grace so free
[V2]
.Em   D C  C/B                  C
 Here I am knowing I'm a sinful man
.C/B                         D  Bm 
 Covered by the blood of the Lamb
 
[B]
.    Em  D/F# G                          Em  D/F# G
 And now I've found the greatest love of all is mine
.                         A 
 Since You laid down your life

 The greatest sacrifice
 
[C]
.G   D/F# Em   C
 Majesty, majesty
.     G                            D/F#

 Empty handed but alive in Your hands
[D]
.G   D/F# Em     C 
 Majesty, majesty

 In the beauty of Your majesty
 
[V3]
 Here I am humbled by the love that You give
 Forgiven so that I can forgive
[V4]
 Here I stand knowing I am Your design
 Sanctified by glory and fire</lyrics></song>
