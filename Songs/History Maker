  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Am                   F
 Is it true today that when people pray
.          Am
 Cloudless skies will break,
.          F
 Kings and queens will shake?
[V2]
.          G             F
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it,
.                 C   G/B   Am7   F
 I'm living for You.
 
[V3]
 Is it true today, that when people pray
 We'll see dead men rise,
 And the blind set free?
[V4]
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it,
 I'm living for You. 
 
[C1]
.C                      Am               F
 I'm gonna be a history maker in this land.
.C                         Am                F
 I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind.
.C             G/B Am       F             C    G/B
 I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run into Your arms,
[c2]
.          Am      F
 Into Your arms again,
.           C   G/B          Am      F     [C(no3)]
 Into Your arms, into Your arms again.
 
[V5]
 Is it true today, that when people stand
 With the fire of God and the truth in hand,
 We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing,
[V6]
 We'll see broken hearts making history?
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it.
 I'm living for you.</lyrics></song>
