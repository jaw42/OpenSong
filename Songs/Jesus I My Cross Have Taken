  <lyrics>[V1]
.D       F#m   G            D
 Jesus, I my   cross have taken,
.D       F#m      G       A
 All to leave and follow Thee.
.D        F#m    G         D
 Destitute,   despised, forsaken,
.D           F#m    G         D
 Thou from hence my all shall be.

[V2]
.Bm      Bm/A G        D
 Perish every fond ambition,
.Bm         Bm/A      G      D
 All I’ve sought or hoped or known.
.Bm      Bm/A    G     D
 Yet how rich is my condition!
.Em  D/F#  G          A        D   G D A
 God and   heaven are still my own.
 
[V3]
 Let the world despise and leave me,
 They have left my Savior, too.
 Human hearts and looks deceive me;
 Thou art not, like them, untrue.

[V4]
 O while Thou dost smile upon me,
 God of wisdom, love, and might,
 Foes may hate and friends disown me,
 Show Thy face and all is bright.
 
[V5]
 Man may trouble and distress me,
 ’Twill but drive me to Thy breast.
 Life with trials hard may press me;
 Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.

[V6]
 Oh, ’tis not in grief to harm me
 While Thy love is left to me;
 Oh, ’twere not in joy to charm me,
 Were that joy unmixed with Thee.
 
[V7]
 Go, then, earthly fame and treasure,
 Come disaster, scorn and pain
 In Thy service, pain is pleasure,
 With Thy favor, loss is gain

[V8]
 I have called Thee Abba Father,
 I have stayed my heart on Thee
 Storms may howl, and clouds may gather;
 All must work for good to me.
 
[V9]
 Soul, then know thy full salvation
 Rise o’er sin and fear and care
 Joy to find in every station,
 Something still to do or bear.

[V10]
 Think what Spirit dwells within thee,
 Think what Father’s smiles are thine,
 Think that Jesus died to win thee,
 Child of heaven, canst thou repine.
 
[V11]
 Haste thee on from grace to glory,
 Armed by faith, and winged by prayer.
 Heaven’s eternal days before thee,
 God’s own hand shall guide us there.

[V12]
 Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
 Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days,
 Hope shall change to glad fruition,
 Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
 
[V13]
.E       G#m A            E
 Jesus, I my cross have taken,
.E       G#m      A       B
 All to leave and follow Thee.
.E        G#m    A         E
 Destitute,   despised, forsaken,
.E           G#m    A         E
 Thou from hence my all shall be.
.C#m     C#m/B A        E
 Perish every  fond ambition,
.C#m        C#m/B     A      E
 All I’ve sought or hoped or known.
.C#m     C#m/B   A     E
 Yet how rich is my condition!
.F#m E/G# A          B        E   A E B
 God and  heaven are still my own.
