  <lyrics>[V1]
.G             C 
 In the quiet, in the stillness
.  Am                D 
 I know that You are God
.G             C 
 In the secret of Your presence
[V2]
.  Am              D 
 I know there I am restored
.Am       G      C    G/B  D 
 When You call I won’t refuse
.Am       G    C    G/B  D 
 Each new day again I’ll choose
 
[C1]
.Em              C   G/B  D 
 There is no one else for me
.Am 
 None but Jesus
[C2]
.Em           C  G/BD  
 Crucified to set me free
.      Am 
 Now I live to bring Him praise
 
[V3]
 In the chaos, in confusion
 I know You’re Sovereign still
[V4]
 In the moment of my weakness
 You give me grace to do Your will
[V5]
 When You call I won’t delay
 This my song through all my days
 
.Em  C  D  G  D/F#  
[B]
.Em       C       G/B     D 
 All my delight is in You Lord
.          Am              Em 
 All of my hope, all of my strength
.         C       G/B     D           Am 
 All my delight is in You Lord Forevermore</lyrics></song>
