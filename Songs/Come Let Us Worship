  <lyrics>[C1]
 For He is our God
 And we are His people
 (Yes) He is our God
 And we will never be forsaken

[V1]
 Come let us worship and bow down
 Before the Lord Most Holy
 Before the King of glory

[V2]
 Come and lay your burdens down
 Before the Friend who's faithful
 Before the One who's able

[V3]
 Come let us lift our voice in praise
 Unto the Rock of Ages
 Unto the God who saves us

[V4]
 Come and glorify His name
 All the earth together
 All the saints forever

[C2]
 You are our God
 And we are Your people
 You are our God
 And we will be with You forever</lyrics></song>
