.G                                  C                 
 You're calling me to lay aside the worries of my day 
.Em7                            C                   
 To quiet down my busy mind and find a hiding place 
.G   C           Em7C   
 Worthy, You are worthy 
.G                               C                  
 I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours 
.  Em7                        C                         
 I open up my mouth and let a song of praise come forth 
.G   C           Em7C   
 Worthy, You are worthy 

[B]
.G                        C                   
 Of a childlike faith and of my honest praise 
.    Em7             C    
 And of my unashamed love 
.G                  C               
 Of a holy life and of my sacrifice 
.    Em7             C    
 And of my unashamed love
