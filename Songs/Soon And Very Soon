  <lyrics>[V1]
 Soon and very soon
 We are going to see the King
 Soon and very soon
 We are going to see the King
 Soon and very soon
 We are going to see the King||
 Hallelujah hallelujah
 We're going to see the King

[V2]
 No more crying there
 We are going to see the King
 No more crying there
 We are going to see the King
 No more crying there
 We are going to see the King||
 Hallelujah hallelujah
 We're going to see the King

[V3]
 No more dying there
 We are going to see the King
 No more dying there
 We are going to see the King
 No more dying there
 We are going to see the King||
 Hallelujah hallelujah
 We're going to see the King

[B]
 Should there be any rivers we must cross
 Should there be any mountains we must climb
 God will supply all the strength that we need
 Give us grace till we reach the other side
 We have come from ev'ry nation
 God knows each of us by name||
 Jesus took His blood and washed my sins
 And He washed them all away
 Yes there are some of us
 Who have laid down our lives
 But we all shall live again on the other side</lyrics></song>
