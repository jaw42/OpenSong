[V1]
 We are a City in a Hill
 Shining Your light into the dark
 We will stand, til the end - til You return
 
[V2]
 We stand for justice and hope
 Help the poor, feed the hungry
 Care for the orphans, find the lost
 Light up this world
 
[C1]
 We will arise and shine
 For our light has come
 And the glory of the Lord is risen upon us
 
[V3]
 Nations will come to this light
 Kings to the brightness of this dawn
 Sons from afar - daughters carried in arms
 
[V4]
 Our hearts burst for this day
 Save the nations we pray
 Lord You are our everlasting light
 
[B1]
 All for Your glory
 All for Your name
 To You O God be all the praise</lyrics></song>
