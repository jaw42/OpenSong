 Jesus is the answer
 For the world today
 Above Him there's no other
 Jesus is the way
 Jesus is the answer
 For the world today||
 Above Him there's no other
 Jesus is the way

[V1]
 If you have some questions
 In the corners of your mind
 Traces of discouragement
 And peace you cannot find
 Reflections of your past
 Seem to face you ev'ry day||
 But this one thing I do know
 Jesus is the way</lyrics></song>
