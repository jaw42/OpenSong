.C                           G
 The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
.F                  C
 Slow to anger, and rich in love.

.C                     G
 As far as the east is from the west,
.           F                            C
 that's how far, he has removed our transgressions from us
.C                     G
 As far as the east is from the west,
.           F                            C
 that's how far, he has removed our transgressions from us.
