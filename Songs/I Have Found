  <lyrics>[C]
 I worship You my Lord
 With all my life praise Your name
 I worship You
 Worship You my Lord

[V1]
 I have found such joy in my salvation
 Since I gave my heart to You
 I have found the reason I'm living
 So in love so near to You

[V2]
 Oh my Lord my life I'm giving
 A living sacrifice to You
 Oh my Lord the reason I'm living
 Is to serve and worship You</lyrics></song>
