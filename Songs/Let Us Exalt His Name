  <lyrics>[V1]
.   Em               Bm7        
 At all times I will bless Him, 
.    C                    GMaj7  
 His praise will be in my mouth, 
.   Am7            Em            B7sus  B7
 My soul makes its boast in the  Lord;  
.     Em              Bm7          
 The humble man will hear of Him, 
.    C                 GMaj7
 the afflicted will be glad 
.     Am7        Bm7
 And join with me  
.   CMaj7 Em/C#      Am7/D   D
 to magni_fy    the  Lord. 

[C]
.         G       D/F#   Em        Bm7   
 Let us exalt His name together forever, 
.  Am7                 Bm7      
 I sought the Lord, He heard me 
.      CMaj7      Em/C#    Am7/D  
 and delivered me from my  fears; 
.         G       D/F#   Em        Bm7   
 Let us exalt His name together forever, 
.  C        Am7     Bm7         Em    
 O sing His praises magnify the Lord. 

[V2]
.    Em           Bm7                 C                  GMaj7 
 The angel of the Lord encamps 'round those who fear His name, 
.   Am7             Em              B7sus  B7
 To save them and deliver them from harm;  
.       Em              Bm7        C                GMaj7  
 Though lions roar with hunger, we lack for no good thing, 
.   Am7    Bm7     CMaj7      Em/C#    Am7/D   D 
 No wonder then we praise Him with our song. 

[V3]
.     Em               Bm7        C                  GMaj7 
 Come children now and hear me if you would see long life, 
.     Am7                 Em             B7sus  B7
 Just keep your lips from wickedness and lies;  
.   Em                 Bm7        C                GMaj7   
 Do good and turn from evil, seek peace instead of strife, 
.     Am7      Bm7      CMaj7    Em/C#     Am7/D
 Love righteousness and God will hear your cry.
