  <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing to the Lord with all your heart
 Sing of the glory that's due to His name
[V2]
 Sing to the Lord with all of Your soul
 Join all of heaven and earth to proclaim
 
[C1]
 You are the Lord, the Saviour of all
 God of creation, we praise You
[C2]
 We sing the songs that awaken the dawn
 God of creation, we praise You
 
[V3]
 Sing to the Lord with all of your mind
 With understanding give thanks to the King
[V4]
 Sing to the Lord with all of your strength
 Living our lives as a praise offering</lyrics></song>
