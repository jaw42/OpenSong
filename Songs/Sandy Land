  <lyrics>[C]
 Don't build your house on the sandy land
 Don't build it too near the shore
 Well it might look kind of nice
 But you'll have to build it twice
 Oh you'll have to build your house once more
 You better build your house upon a Rock||
 Make a good foundation on a solid spot
 Oh the storms may come and go
 But the peace of God you will know</lyrics></song>
