  <lyrics>[C]
 Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
 O love of God how rich and pure
 How measureless and strong
 It shall forevermore endure
 The saints' and angels' song

[V1]
 The love of God is greater far
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell
 It goes beyond the highest star
 And reaches to the lowest hell
 The guilty pair bowed down with care
 God gave His Son to win||
 His erring child He reconciled
 And pardoned from his sin

[V2]
 Could we with ink the ocean fill
 And were the skies of parchment made
 Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill
 And ev'ry man made a scribe by trade
 To write the love of God above
 Would drain the ocean dry||
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole
 Though stretched from sky to sky</lyrics>
