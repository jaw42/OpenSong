.D              A/C#
 I have heard so many songs
.D/C           G/B  
 Listened to a thousand tongues
[V2]
.    Em 
 But there is one 
.     A                   Bm  A/C#  G 
 That sounds above them all
 
[V3]
.D                      A/C#
 The Father's song, the Father's love
.D/C              G/B 
 You sung it over me and for
. Em           A             D 
 Eternity it's written on my heart
 
 
[C1]
.D/F#               G/B    A/C#
 Heaven's perfect melody
.               D/F#    G 
 The Creator's symphony
[C2]
.        D/F#    Em      Asus 
 You are singing over me

 The Father's song
[D1]
.D/F#             G       A/C#
 Heaven's perfect mystery
.                     D/F#        G 
 The King of love has sent for me
[D2]
.                       Em     A 
 And now You're singing over me
.              D
