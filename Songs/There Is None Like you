  <lyrics>[V1]
.G        D         Em
 There is none like You;
.C      G/B              Am              D
 No one else can touch my heart like You do.
[V2]
.G       D                Em     C
 I could search for all eternity long
.          G        D         G
 And find, there is none like You.
 
[V3]
.C                       G     Em
 Your mercy flows like a river wide
.   Am       D               G
 And healing comes from Your hands.
[V4]
.C                      G            Em
 Suffering children are safe in Your arms.
.Am            C    D
 There is none like You.</lyrics></song>
