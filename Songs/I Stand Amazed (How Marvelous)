  <lyrics>[V1]
.C F                   F
 I stand amazed in the presence
.F/A C         Bb  F
 Of  Jesus the Nazarene
.    Bb                  F    F/A
 And wonder how He could love me
.  F/C       C7       F
 A sinner condemned unclean
 
[C]
.F
 How marvelous, how wonderful
.C
 And my song shall ever be
.F              Dm
 How marvelous, how wonderful
.Gm    F/A      Bb   C   F
 Is my Savior's love for me
 
[V2]
 For me it was in the garden
 He prayed not My will but Thine
 He had no tears for His own griefs
 But sweat drops of blood for mine
 
[V3]
 In pity angels beheld Him
 And came from the world of light
 To comfort Him in the sorrows
 He bore for my soul that night
---
[V4]
 He took my sins and my sorrows
 He made them His very own
 He bore the burden to Calvary
 And suffered and died alone
 
[V5]
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me</lyrics>
