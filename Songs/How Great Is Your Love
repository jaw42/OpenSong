  <lyrics>[C]
 How high and how wide
 How deep and how long
 How sweet and how strong
 Is Your love
 How lavish Your grace
 How faithful Your ways
 How great is Your love O Lord
 
[V1]
 No eye has seen
 And no ear has heard
 And no mind has ever conceived
 The glorious things
 That You have prepared for ev'ryone
 Who has believed||
 You brought us near
 And You called us Your own
 And made us joint heirs
 With Your Son
 
[V2]
 Objects of mercy
 Who should have known wrath
 We're filled with unspeakable joy
 Riches of wisdom unsearchable wealth
 And the wonder of knowing Your voice||
 You are our treasure
 And our great reward
 Our hope and our glorious King</lyrics>
