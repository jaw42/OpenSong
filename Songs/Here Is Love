  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                 D      G
 Here is love vast as the ocean,
.                       D
 Loving kindness as the flood,
[V2]
.         G                   C      
 When the Prince of life, our ransom 
.         G      D        G
 Shed for us his precious blood.
[V3]
.        G               D
 Who His love will not remember
.        C  D              G
 Who can cease to sing His praise
[V4]
.       G           C
 He can never be forgotten,
.           G         D      G   
 Throughout heav'n's eternal days.
 
[V5]
 On the Mount of Crucifixion,
 Fountains opened deep and wide,
[V6]
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy,
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
[V7]
 Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
 Poured incessant from above,
[V8]
 And heaven's peace and perfect justice,
 Kissed a guilty world in love.</lyrics></song>
