.D                  G        A          D
 I will offer up my life, in spirit and truth
.                       G           A          D
 Pouring out the oil of love, in my worship to You
[V2]
.                    G       A     Bm
 In surrender I must give my every part
.                 A    G         A      D
 Lord receive the sacrifice of a broken heart
 
[C1]
.D                G     A          D
 Jesus what can I give, what can I bring
.                 G             A        D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
[C2]
.                    G     A           D
 Saviour what can be said, what can be sung
.                    G
 As a praise of Your name
[D1]
.        A               D
 For the things You have done
.                       Em        D/F#    G
 Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
[D2]
.D/F#   Em      D/F#         G
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.   A             D
 By this thankful heart
 
[V3]
 You deserve my every breath, for You've paid the great cost
 Given up Your life to death, even death on a cross
[V4]
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
 Opened up the gates of heaven and beckoned me in
 
[T]
 What can I give, what can I bring
 What can I sing as an offering Lord</lyrics></song>
