.E                           D                        A
 I will worship (echo) |with all of my heart; (echo) |I will praise You,

 With all of my strength; |all my strength.||
.E                 D                   A
 I will seek You, |all of my days |And I will follow

 Follow all of Your ways; |all Your ways.

 I will give You all my worship;

 You alone I long to worship;

 You alone are worthy of my praise.
