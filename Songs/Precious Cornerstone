  <lyrics>[C]
 There is no rock like our God
 There is no rock like our God
 Precious cornerstone
 I stand on You alone
 There is no rock like our God

[V1]
 Neither life nor death
 Nor any other power
 Can keep me from the love
 Of Christ my Lord
 Nothing in this world
 Can keep His love from me||
 There is no rock like our God</lyrics></song>
