  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hear O Lord and answer
 I am poor and needy
 Guard my life
 For I am devoted to You
 Hear my prayer O Lord
 And my cry for mercy
 In this day of trouble
 I will call to You

[V2]
 Teach me O Lord
 I will walk in Your truth
 Give me an undivided heart
 Nations You've made
 Will worship You
 For You alone
 Are the living God

[C]
 I will praise You
 I will praise You
 Glorify Your name O Lord
 I will praise You
 I will praise You
 Glorify Your name O Lord</lyrics></song>
