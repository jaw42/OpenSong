  <lyrics>[Estribillo1]
 We come into this holy place
 To bring a sacrifice of praise
 Bow down before You and seek Your face
 We sing of the mighty things You've done
 Cry out to You let Your will be done
 Tell all the world You're the Holy One||

[PREC]
 Hear the shouts of praise
 As they're rising up to You
 Come and fill this place
 As we bring glory to Your name

[Coro1]
 Open up the gates
 And let the King of glory in
 Fill this house with praises
 As we lift our hands and worship You
 Open up the doors
 And let Your glory fill the earth||
 King of heaven we dance before Your throne

[B]
 King of heaven
 Come and take Your place
 Dwell among us
 As we seek Your face</lyrics></song>
