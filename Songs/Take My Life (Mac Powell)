.G        C
 How many times
.     D        G
 Have I turned away
.    C             G
 The number is the same
.       D
 As the sand on the shore
.G     C           D        G
 Every time You've taken me back
.    C         
 And now I pray
.       D          G
 You'll do it once more

[V2]
.G        C
 How many times
.     D      G
 Have I gone astray
.    C             G
 The number is the same
.       D
 As the stars in the sky
.G     C           D        G
 Every time You've taken me back
.    C
 And now I pray
.       D       G
 You'll do it tonight</lyrics></song>
