 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 For He is our Rock for He is our Rock
 He is the Lord||
 For He is our Rock for He is our Rock
 He is the Lord

[V2]
 Jesus reigns on high in all the earth
 Jesus reigns on high in all the earth
 Jesus reigns on high in all the earth
 Jesus reigns on high in all the earth
 The universe is in the hands of the Lord
 The universe is in the hands of the Lord||</lyrics></song>
