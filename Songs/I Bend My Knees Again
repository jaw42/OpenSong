  <lyrics>[C]
 I bend my knees again
 I seek Your face
 Lord You are life to me
 I am Yours alone my God
 I am Yours alone my God

[V1]
 O Lord this calloused heart
 It needs Your touch
 Come place Your hands on me
 I need Your touch
 So many things
 I've taken for granted||
 Please help me fall in love
 All over again
 Increase my passion
 My longing my yearning for You</lyrics></song>
