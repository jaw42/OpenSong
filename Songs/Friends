  <lyrics>[C]
 And friends are friends forever
 If the Lord's the Lord of them
 And a friend will not say never
 'Cause the welcome will not end
 Though it's hard to let you go
 In the Father's hands we know||
 That a life-time's not too long
 To live as friends

[V1]
 Packing up the dreams God planted
 In the fertile soil of you
 Can't believe the hopes He's granted
 Means a chapter in your life's through
 But we'll keep you close as always
 It won't even seem you've gone||
 'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong

[V2]
 With the faith and love God's given
 Springing from the hope we know
 We will pray the joy you'll live in
 Is the strength that now you show
 But we'll keep you close as always
 It won't even seem you've gone||
 'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong</lyrics></song>
