[v1] 
;Verse 1
.Am           G           F         C 
 This is my prayer in the desert
.    Am             G          F    C
 When all thats within me feels dry
.Am         G           F          C
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need
.  Am         G       F
 My God is the God who provides
 
[v2]
;Verse 2
.Am        G             F       C
 This is my prayer in the fire 
.  Am          G         F       C
 In weakness or trial or pain 
.Am        G               F               C
 There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
.    Am       C/E              F
 So refine me Lord through the flame

;Chorus
.                C                    G
 And I will bring praise, I will bring praise
.         F                        C
 No weapon formed against me shall remain
.G/B      G               Am
 I will rejoice, I will declare
.          F           G     Am
 God is my victory and He is here
 
[v3]
;Verse 3
.Am         G             F      C 
 This is my prayer in the battle 
.     Am         G            F   C
 When triumph is still on its way 
.Am    G             F            C
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ 
.   Am          G             F 
 So firm on His promise I'll stand

 All of my life, In every season
.Am
 You are still God
.                   G

.F                  C
 I have a reason to worship
 
[v4]
;Verse 4
 This is my prayer in the harvest
 When favour and providence flow
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again
 The seed I've received I will sow</lyrics></song>
