  <lyrics>[C]
 Knowing You Jesus knowing You
 There is no greater thing
 You're my all You're the best
 You're my joy my righteousness
 And I love You Lord

[V1]
 All I once held dear built my life upon
 All this world reveres and wars to own
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss
 Spent and worthless now compared to this

[V2]
 Now my heart's desire is to know You more
 To be found in You and known as Yours
 To possess by faith what I could not earn
 All surpassing gift of righteousness

[V3]
 Oh to know the pow'r of Your risen life
 And to know You in Your sufferings
 To become like You in Your death my Lord
 So with You to live and never die</lyrics>
