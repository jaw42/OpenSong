[V]
.C           F          C            F
1I lift my   eyes up,   up to the    mountains,
2You keep my feet firm, You will not slumber,
.C             F    C    G
1Where does my help come from?
2Oh Lord You   keep me   whole.
.C             F           C         F
1My help comes from You,   Maker of  heaven,
2You're at my  right hand, a Shade beside me,
.C         F  C   G
1Creator   of the earth.
2Preserver of my  soul.

[C]
.C       F         C
 O how I need You, Lord,
.           F    C
 You are my only hope,
.          F C  G
 You're my only prayer;
.C         F        C
 So I will wait for You
.            F      C
 To come and rescue me,
.         F    C  G
 Come and give me life.</lyrics>
