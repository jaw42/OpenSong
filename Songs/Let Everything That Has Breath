 Let everything that, everything that,

 Everything that has breath praise the Lord 
[C2]

 Everything that has breath praise the Lord  
 
[V1]

 Praise You in the morning,
.D/C#
 Praise You in the evening,
.Bm                                     G
 Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old.
[V2]
.D               
 Praise You when I'm laughing,
.D/C#
 Praise You when I'm grieving,
.Bm                             G
 Praise You every season of the soul.
 
[B]
.   Em               D
 If we could see how much You're worth,
.     Em                      D
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love
.     Em              D              G
 Then surely we would never cease to praise
 
[V3]
 Praise You in the heavens,
 Joining with the angels,
 Praise You forever and a day.
[V4]h
 Praise You on the earth now,
 Joining with creation,
 Calling all the nations to Your praise.
 
[T]

.Bm             G              D
 I will worship You with every breath
