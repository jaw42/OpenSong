  <lyrics>[V1]
.A
 With all I'm holding inside
.A                        D
 With all my hopes and desires
.                             A
 And all the dreams that I've dreamt
[V2]
.A
 With all I'm hoping to be
.A                           D
 And all that the world will bring
.                      
 And all that fails to compare
[V3]
.    F#m          E      D
 You say You want all of me
.           F#m         E     A
 I wouldn't have it any other way
 
[C1]
.A                                        D  
 I've got a Saviour and He's living in me whoa
.        F#m   B            D     A
 I wanna know, I wanna know You today
[C2]
.A                           
 You're the best thing that has happened to me
.             F#m       
 And what the world will never take
.    B          D              A
 The world will never take You away
 
[T]
.                  D         A             
 No one could ever take You away (repeat)
