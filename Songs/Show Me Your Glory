  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                        Am 
 I caught glimpse of Your splendour
.       C      G     F
 In the corner of my eye
.                   Am             G
 The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen
[V2]
.F                          Am 
 And it was like a flash of lightning
.  C       G       F
 Reflected off the sky
.                Am           G    C
 And I know I'll never be the same
 
[C1]
.C            Am 
 Show me Your glory
.F   
 Send down Your presence
.                   G  C
 I want to see Your face
[C2]
.             Am 
 Show me Your glory
.F  
 Majesty shines about You
.                              Am  C  G  F
 I can't go on without You, Lord
 
[V3]
 When I climb down the mountain
 And get back to my life
 I won't settle for ordinary things
[V4]
 I'm gonna follow You forever
 And for all of my days
 I won't rest 'til I see You again</lyrics></song>
