[C]
.E             B            E    
 Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet 
.      A       B     E     
 And a light unto my path. 
.              B            E    
 Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet 
.      A       B     E     
 And a light unto my path. 

[V1]
.B            F#m    
 When I feel afraid, 
.C#m                G#m  
 think I've lost my way, 
.A            B             A    E   
 Still You're there right beside me. 
.B              F#m     C#m             G#m   
 Nothing will I fear as long as You are near. 
.A         B       C#sus  C#  B
 Please be near me to the end. 

[V2]
 I will not forget Your love for me
 And yet my heart forever is wandering
 Jesus be my guide, hold me to Your side,
 And I will love You to the end.

[E]
 And a light unto my path.
 You're the light unto my path.
