 (Rend the heavens)
 
[V1]
 Spirit of the Living God
 We have fallen without You in our hearts
 We are sorry come and live in us again
[V2]
 Spirit of the Living God
 Come and reign and rule over all
 Fill our cups, renew a right spirit in us
 
[C1]
 Holy Spirit, rain down on us
 Rain down on us, rain down on us
[C2]
 To overflowing rain down on us 
 Rain down on us, rain down on us
 
[V3]
 Spirit of the Living God
 Nothing compares to the gifts You pour on us
 You said ask and we will receive by faith
[V4]
 Spirit of the Living God
 We need Your power to flow through us
 We rely upon Your miracles
 
[V5]
 Spirit of the Living God
 Stir us up with Your desires
 May our hearts take pleasure in You
[V6]
 Spirit of the Living God
 Start something here that can't be stopped
 Let revival begin in us today  </lyrics></song>
