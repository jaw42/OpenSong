  <lyrics>[V1]
 And can it be that I should gain
 An int'rest in the Saviour's blood
 Died He for me who caused His pain
 For me who Him to death pursued
 Amazing love
 How can it be||
 That You my God should die for me

[V2]
 What myst'ry this the Immortal dies
 Who could predict His strange design
 In vain the firstborn angel tried
 To sound the depths of love divine
 What mercy this let earth adore
 Let angel minds inquire no more||

[V3]
 He left His Father's throne above
 So free and infinite His grace
 Emptied Himself of all but love
 And bled to save our helpless race
 What mercy this immense and free
 For O my God it captured me||

[V4]
 Long my imprisoned spirit lay
 Fast bound in sin and nature's night
 You sought me there turned night to day
 I woke the dungeon flamed with light
 My chains fell off revived made new
 I rose went forth and followed You||

[V5]
 No condemnation now I dread
 Jesus and all in Him is mind
 Alive in Him my living head
 And clothed in righteousness divine
 Bold I approach the eternal throne
 And claim the crown through Christ my own||</lyrics></song>
