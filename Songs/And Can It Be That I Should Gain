  <lyrics>1 And can it be that I should gain
2 'Tis mystery all: th'Immortal dies:
3 He left His Father's throne above
4 Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
5 Still the small inward voice I hear,
6 No condemnation now I dread;

1 An interest in the Savior's blood?
2 Who can explore His strange design?
3 So free, so infinite His grace-
4 Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
5 That whispers all my sins forgiven;
6 Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;

1 Died He for me, who caused His pain-
2 In vain the firstborn seraph tries
3 Emptied Himself of all but love,
4 Thine eye diffused a quickening ray-
5 Still the atoning blood is near,
6 Alive in Him, my living Head,

1 For me, who Him to death pursued?
2 To sound the depths of love divine.
3 And bled for Adam's helpless race:
4 I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
5 That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.
6 And clothed in righteousness divine,

1 Amazing love! How can it be,
2 'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
3 'Tis mercy all, immense and free,
4 My chains fell off, my heart was free,
5 I feel the life His wounds impart;
6 Bold I approach th'eternal throne,

1 That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me? [x2]
2 Let angel minds inquire no more. [x2]
3 For O my God, it found out me! [x2]
4 I rose, went forth, and followed Thee. [x2]
5 I feel the Savior in my heart. [x2]
6 And claim the crown, through Christ my own. [x2]</lyrics>
