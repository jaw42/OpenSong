  <lyrics>[C]
 Your love is deep
 Your love is high
 Your love is long
 Your love is wide
 Your love is deep
 Your love is high||
 Your love is long
 Your love is wide

[V1]
 Your love is deeper than my view of grace
 Higher than this worldly place
 Longer than this road I travel
 Wider than the gap You filled
 Deeper than my view of grace
 Higher than this worldly place||
 Longer than this road I travel
 Wider than the gap You filled

[B]
 Who shall separate us
 Who shall separate us from Your love
 Nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus
 Nothing can separate us from Your love
 'Cause Your love is
 It's deeper it's higher it's longer||
 Wider than the gap You filled
 It's deeper it's higher it's longer
 Than this road I travel
 Wider than the gap You filled</lyrics></song>
