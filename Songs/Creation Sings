  <lyrics>[V1]
 Creation sings the Father's song;
 He calls the sun to wake the dawn
 And run the course of day
 Till evening comes in crimson rays.||
 His fingerprints in flakes of snow,
 His breath upon this spinning globe,
 He charts the eagle's flight;
 Commands the newborn baby's cry.
 
[C]
 Hallelujah!
 Let all creation stand and sing,
 Hallelujah!
 Fill the earth with songs of worship;
 Tell the wonders of creation's King. 
 
[V2]
 Creation gazed upon His face;
 The ageless One in time's embrace
 Unveiled the Father's plan
 Of reconciling God and man.||
 A second Adam walked the earth,
 Whose blameless life would break the curse,
 Whose death would set us free
 To live with Him eternally.
 
[V3]
 Creation longs for His return,
 When Christ shall reign upon the earth;
 The bitter wars that rage
 Are birth pains of a coming age.||
 When He renews the land and sky,
 All heaven will sing and earth reply
 With one resplendent theme:
 The glory of our God and King!
