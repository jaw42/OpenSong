 We love You Lord
 We love You we love You
 We love You Lord
 We love You we love You

[V1]
 When we sing hear our songs to You
 When we dance feel us move to You
 When we laugh fill our smiles with You
 When we lift our voices louder still
 Can You hear us can You feel

[V2]
 When we sing loud hear our songs to You
 When we dance 'round feel us move to You
 When we laugh aloud fill our smiles with You
 When we lift our voices louder still
 Can You hear us can You feel

[B1]
 And our love is big our love is loud
 Fill this place with this love now
 And our love is big our love is loud
 Fill this place with this love now

[B2]
 And our love is big our love is loud
 Fill this place with this love now
 And our love is big our love is loud
 Fill our lungs to sing it now

[T]
 We lift our voices louder still
 Our God is near our God is here
 We lift our voices louder still
 Our God is near our God is here</lyrics></song>
