  <lyrics>[C]
.E         B         C#m E7
 Turn your eyes upon Je__sus,
.     A           F#m       B
 Look full in His wonderful face;
.        E         E7
 And the things of earth
.          A         Am/F#
 Will grow strangely dim
.       E            B7        E
 In the light of His glory and grace.

 Look full in His wonderful face;

[V1]
 O soul are you weary and troubled
 No light in the darkness you see
 There's light for a look at the Savior
 And life more abundant and free
 
[V2]
 Through death into life everlasting
 He passed and we follow Him there
 Over us sin no more hath dominion
 For more than conquerors we are
 
[V3]
 His Word shall not fail you He promised
 Believe Him and all will be well
 Then go to a world that is dying
 His perfect salvation to tell
