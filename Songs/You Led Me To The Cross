  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                 D/F#                Em 
 You led me to the cross and I saw the face of mercy
.        C            G 
 In that place of love
.                D/F#                  Em 
 You opened up my eyes to believe Your sweet salvation
[V2]
.         C 
 Where I'd been so blind
.A            C              G            D/F#
 Now that I'm living in Your all forgiving love
.A        C          D        G 
 My every road leads to the cross
 
[C1]
.G     D/F#              Em 
 Jesus, keep me near the cross
.A          C                   G 
 I won't forget the love You've shown
.        D/F#             Em 
 Saviour, teach me of the cross
[C2]
.A  
 I won't forget the love,
.C                              G 
 I won't forget the love You've shown
 
[V3]
 And there's an empty tomb
 That tells me of Your resurrection
 And my life in You
[V4]
 The stone lies rolled away
 Nothing but those folded grave clothes
 Where your body lay
[V5]
 Now that I'm living as a risen child of God
 My every road leads to the cross</lyrics></song>
