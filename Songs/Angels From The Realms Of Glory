  <lyrics>[V1]
 Angels from the realms of glory
 Wing your flight o'er all the earth
 Ye who sang creation's story
 Now proclaim Messiah's birth
 Come and worship come and worship
 Worship Christ the newborn King
 
[V2]
 Shepherds in the fields abiding
 Watching o'er your flocks by night
 God with man is now residing
 Yonder shines the infant Light
 Come and worship come and worship
 Worship Christ the newborn King
 
[V3]
 Sages leave your contemplations
 Brighter visions beam afar
 Seek the great Desire of nations
 Ye have seen His natal star
 Come and worship come and worship
 Worship Christ the newborn King
 
[V4]
 Saints before the altar bending
 Watching long in hope and fear
 Suddenly the Lord descending
 In His temple shall appear
 Come and worship come and worship
 Worship Christ the newborn King
 
[V5]
 All creation join in praising
 God the Father Spirit Son
 Evermore your voices raising
 To the eternal Three in One
 Come and worship come and worship
 Worship Christ the newborn King</lyrics>
