  <lyrics>[V1]
 Make me a prayer
 Let my prayer be a cry
 Humble my heart
 So that You may draw nigh
 Cause me to stand
 And cry out for this land||
 Cause me to be
 One who's set free
 To stand as a house of prayer

[V2]
 Make us a prayer
 Let our prayers be a cry
 Humble our hearts
 So that You may draw nigh
 Cause us to stand
 And cry out for this land||
 Cause us to be
 A people set free
 Who stand as a house of prayer</lyrics></song>
