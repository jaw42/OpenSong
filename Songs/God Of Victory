  <lyrics>[V1]
 We are more than conquerers,
 We are more than conquerers
[V2]
 We are more than conquerers
 Through Christ, the risen Lord
[V3]
 God of victory
 You command Yours blessings on me
 God whom I believe in
[V4]
 Was broken and crushed for me
 God of my everything
[V5]
 You bring Your sweetness deep inside
 God of love and of power and of a sound mind
[V6]
 Yes You are my God
 I've nothing else to rely upon
 Yes You are my God
[V7]
 I put all my hope in You
 It's Your name I depend on
 To bring me through
[V8]
 Yes You are my God
 God of victory</lyrics></song>
