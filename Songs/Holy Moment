  <lyrics>[C]
 Come come come let us worship God
 With our hands held high
 And our hearts bowed down||
 We will run run run
 Through Your gates O God
 With a shout of love
 
[V1]
 As we come today
 We remind ourselves of what we do
 That these songs are not just songs
 But signs of love for You||
 This is a holy moment now
 Something of heaven touches earth
 Voices of angels all resound
 We join their song
 
[V2]
 Lord with confidence
 We come before Your throne of grace
 Not that we deserve to come
 But You have paid the way||
 You are the holy King of all
 Heaven and earth are in Your hands
 All of the angels sing Your song
 We join them now</lyrics>
