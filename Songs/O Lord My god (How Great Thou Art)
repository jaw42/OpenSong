  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                        D
 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder.
.         A       E                    A
 Consider all the works Thy hands have made.
[V2]
.          A                 D
 I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
.               A         E          A
 Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
 
[C1]
.              A       D              A
 Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee.
.               E                   A
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[C2]
.              A       D              A   F#m
 Then sings my soul my saviour God to Thee.
.               D        E          A
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
 
[V3]
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
[V4]
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.
 
[V5]
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,
[V6]
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
 He bled and died to take away my sin.
 
[V7]
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
[V8]
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art.</lyrics></song>
