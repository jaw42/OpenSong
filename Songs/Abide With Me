  <lyrics>[V]
.D  A         D        G        A   D
1Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
2Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
3Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
4Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
5Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
6I need Thy presence every passing hour.
7I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
8Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;

.D            G        E             A
1The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
2Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
3But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
4But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
5And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
6What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
7Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
8Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.

.D    A     D       G                 E
1When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
2Change and decay in all around I see;
3Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
4Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
5Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
6Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
7Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
8Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;

.A            D        G  D    A    D
1Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
2O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
3Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.
4Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.
5On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.
6Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.
7I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
8In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
