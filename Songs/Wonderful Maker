  <lyrics>[V1]
.C2
 You spread out the skies 
.C2
 over empty space
.Em
 Said, "Let there be light."
.     Em
 To a dark and formless world
.               C2   D  G/B
 Your light was born
 
[V2]
.C2
 You spread out Your arms 
.C2
 over empty hearts
.Em
 Said, "Let there be light."
.     Em
 To a dark and hopeless world
.             C2
 Your Son was born
 
 
[B]
.    Am7    
 You made the world
.    G/B             C2
 And saw that it was good
.    Am7            G/B
 You sent Your only Son
.            C2   D/F#
 For You are good

   What a wonderful Maker
.                 Em
 What a wonderful Savior
.                  C2
 How majestic Your whispers
.D/F#                  G
   And how humble Your love||
.                        C2
 With a strength like no other
.                   Em7
 And the heart of a Father
.                  C2
 How majestic Your whispers
.D/F#               Gsus  G
   What a wonderful God
 
 
[V3]
.C2
 No eye has fully seen how beautiful the cross
.    Em7
 And we have only heard the faintest whispers
.                 C2
 of how great You are</lyrics>
