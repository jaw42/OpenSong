  <lyrics>;Verse1
[V1]
 This is the situation
 We're a praised generation
 Goin' out across da nation
 Saved by grace, I'm a new creation
 
 This is our revelation
 
;Chorus
[C1]
 A city on a hill cannot be hidden
 A city on a hill cannot be moved
 God in us will be our rhythm
 The Lighthouse Church, feel this groove
 
;Verse 2
[V2]
 If this squishy church is on your last nerve
 Here's something new that you can learn
 God sent the palace we deserve
 From the very heavens observed</lyrics></song>
