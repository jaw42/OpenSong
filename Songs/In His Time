  <lyrics>[V1]
 In His time in His time
 He makes all things beautiful
 In His time
 Lord please show me ev'ry day
 As You're teaching me Your way
 That You do just what You say
 In Your time
 
[V2]
 In Your time in Your time
 You make all things beautiful
 In Your time
 Lord my life to You I bring
 May each song I have to sing
 Be to You a lovely thing
 In Your time</lyrics>
