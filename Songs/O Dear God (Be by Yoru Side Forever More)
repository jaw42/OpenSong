.G
 O dear God we ask for Your favour
.                            C
 Come and sweep through this place
.  Em   D    C
 O we desire You
 
[V2]
 I just want to be with You
 Be where You are
[V3]
 Dwell in Your presence O God
 O I want to walk with You
 
[C1]
.    G      D          C
 And I will climb this mountain
.    Em     D       C
 And I step off the shore
[C2]
.    G      D        Em
 And I have chosen to follow
.    D          C            G   G/F  G/B  C
 And be by Your side forever more
 
[V4]
 Tell me what You want me to do Lord God
 Tell me what You want for my life
 It's Yours O God, It's Yours
[V5]
 Do Your will have Your way
 Be Lord God in this place
 O I want Your will to be done</lyrics></song>
