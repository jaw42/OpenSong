  <lyrics>[V1]
.            D           A
 Would you believe me if I said
.     F#m        E            D        A
 That we are the ones who can make the change
.       F#m     E 
 In the world today
[V2]
.            D           A             
 Would you believe me if I said
.     F#m          E              D
 That all of those dreams in your heart 
.         A    F#m  E 
 Can come true today 
[V3]
.          D             A
 Would you believe me if I said
.    F#m          E            D          A   F#m   E   D
 That life can be all that you want it to be today
 
[C1]
.             D             A
 And If I had wings I would fly 
.                 E 
 Cause all that I need, You are
.           D               Bm   
 And if the world caved in around me
[C2]
.   F#m                E         
 To You I'd still hold on
.             Bm     
 Cause You're all that I believe
[C3]
.        G    
 And the one who created me
.Bm                D
 Jesus, because of You
.    A   D  Bm   F#m  A  D  Bm   F#m
 I'm free
 
[V4]
 Would you believe me if I said
 That God can make miracles happen today
 Yeah, yeah
[V5]
 Would you believe me if I said
 That you don't need to wait for the answers before
 You step out if faith
[V6]
 Would you believe me if I said
 That nothing is ever impossible for God
 
[B]
.D              A                F#m
 Just live your life with God inside
.            E                  D
 You won't regret one moment of it
.             Bm               G
 And give all that you can for God, for God</lyrics></song>
