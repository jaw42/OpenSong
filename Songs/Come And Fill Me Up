  <lyrics>[C]
 Lord let Your mercy
 Wash away all of my sin
 Fill me completely
 With Your love once again
 I need You I want You
 I love Your presence||
 I need You I want You
 I love Your presence

[V1]
 I can feel You flowin' thru me
 Holy Spirit come'n fill me up
 Come and fill me up
 Love'n mercy fill my senses
 I am thirsty for Your presence Lord
 Come and fill me up||</lyrics></song>
