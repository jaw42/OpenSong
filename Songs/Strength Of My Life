  <lyrics>[C]
 Ev'ry day I look to You
 To be the strength of my life
 You're the hope I hold on to
 Be the strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life
 Strength of my life||
 Be the strength of my life today
 Be the strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life
 Strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life today
 
[C2]
 Ev'ry day I look to You
 To be the strength of my life
 Breathe on me and make me new
 Be the strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life
 Strength of my life||
 Be the strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life today
 Be the strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life
 Strength of my life
 Be the strength of my life today
 
[V1]
 I open my eyes
 To the sound of morning news
 And wish for ten more minutes
 Left to sleep
 And as I get into the shower
 The thoughts of facing||
 One more day overwhelm me
 And I begin to weep
 And I've never felt
 Like I've needed Your help so bad
 
[V2]
 Though my tears are pushed away now
 For the sake of morning rush
 'Til the Bible on the table catches my eye
 And I read that You are near
 To the hearts that break with grief
 And I realize that I don't have to try||
 To live life myself
 Because You're ready to help me live
 
[V3]
 Each day has its problems
 Its troubles and its tears
 And it seems I'm always
 Anything but strong
 When I learn to know my weakness
 I understand Your strength||
 And even when the hard times last so long
 I won't try by myself
 I'll just ask for Your help each day</lyrics>
