  <lyrics>.G Em7 G/B C 
 I said on Sunday, how much I want revival  
.G Em7 G/B C 
 then on Monday, I can't even find my Bible  
.D Em7 C G Em7 G/B C 
 Where's the power, the power of the cross in my life? 
.G Em7 G/B C 
 I'm sick of playin' the game of religion  
.G Em7 G/B C 
 I'm tired of losin' my reason for livin' 
.D Em7 C G Em7 G/B C 
 Where's the power the power of the cross in my life? 
.D Em C 
 I'm not content just to walk through my life  
.D Em C 
 Givin' in to the lies walking in compromises  
.D Em C D 
 now we cry out as a generation that was lost  
.Am G/B C Dsus 
 but now is found in the power of the cross 
 
.G D 
 We believe in you  
.Am G/B C D 
 we believe in the power of your word and its truth 
.G D 
 We believe in you  
.Am G/B C D G 
 so we lay down our cause that our cross might be found in you 
 
.Am7 Em D 
 I'm not satisfied doin' it my own way  
.Am7 Em D 
 I'm not satisfied to reject and walk away  
.Am7 G/B C  
 I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but you  
.Am7 Em D 
 I'm not satisfied livin' in yesterday's hour  
.Am7 Em7 D 
 I'm not satisfied to have the form and not the power  
.Am7 G/B C D 
 I'm not satisfied lord I am crucified in you  </lyrics></song>
