  <lyrics>[C]
 Blessed be Your holy name Lord Jesus
 I will never cease to give You praise
 You are Messiah Deliverer
 The Holy One of Israel
 Blessed be Your holy name Lord Jesus
 I will never cease to give You praise||
 You are Messiah Deliverer
 Blessed be Your name

[V1]
 Your name is high above all others
 Your name has set the captives free
 Your name delivers all the nations
 Your name is life and breath to me</lyrics></song>
