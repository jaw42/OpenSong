  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hear my cry, O Lord, 
 Attend unto my prayer,
 From the ends of the earth, 
 will I cry out to Thee;||
 And when my heart is overwelmed,
 Lead me to the Rock
 That is higher than I,
 That is higher than I.

[V2]
 For Thou has been a shelter unto me,
 A high tower, Lord, 
 against the enemy;||
 And when my heart is overwhelmed,
 Lead me to the Rock
 That is higher than I,
 That is higher than I.</lyrics></song>
