  <lyrics>[V1]
.D     D2                 Dsus D
 Come, now is the time to wor__ship,
.A                        Em7       G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart;
.D     D2                 Dsus D
 Come, just as you are to wor__ship,
.A                     Em7         G    D
 Come, just as you are before your God, come.
 
[V2]
.G                            D
 One day every tongue will confess You are God,
.G                       D
 One day every knee will bow;
.G                             Bm7
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
.    Em                A2
 Who gladly choose You now.</lyrics>
