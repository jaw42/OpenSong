.G         C       D         G
 Above all powers, above all kings
.          C          D           G 
 Above all nature and all created things
[V2]
.          Em         D               C  G/B 
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
.Am              C              D/F# 
 You were here before the world began
 
[V3]
.          C        D          G   
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones
.          C           D               G 
 Above all wonders the world have ever known
[V4]
.          Em         D                C   G/B 
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
.Am                C                   Bm 
 There's no way to measure what you're worth
 
[C1]
.G    Am    D/F#            G 
 Crucified, laid behind the stone
.             Am     D/F#        G 
 You lived to die, rejected and alone
[C2]
.       Em   D               C  G/B 
 Like a rose trampled on the ground
.             Am    G/B            C  D 
 You took the fall, and thought of me
.       G 
 Above all</lyrics></song>
