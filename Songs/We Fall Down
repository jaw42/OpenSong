.D                A       Bm 
 We fall down, we lay our crowns,
.       G       A
 At the feet of Jesus;
.    D                 A         Bm 
 The greatness of Your mercy and love,
.       G       A
 At the feet of Jesus.

 And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"
.D/F#         Gmaj7 D/F#  Em 
 And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"
.D/F#         Gmaj7 D/F#  Em 
 And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"

 Is   the Lamb.</lyrics></song>
