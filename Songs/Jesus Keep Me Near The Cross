 Jesus, keep me near the cross
.G                G/D D
 There a precious fountain

 Flows from Calv'ry's mountain

.G              C
 At the cross I stood one day
.G              G/D   D
 Love and mercy found me
.G                    C
 There the bright and morning star

 Shed its beams around me

 Near the cross, O Lamb of God
.G                  G/D  D
 Bring its scenes before me
.G             C
 Help me walk from day to day

 With its shadow o'er me
. G/C Am9 C2/D (2x)

[V4]
.G                   C
 Near the cross I'll watch and wait
.G                G/D D
 Hoping, trusting ev__er,
.G                C
 Till I reach the golden strand
.G               D7 G
 Just beyond the ri_ver..     Gb/Cb    Abm9    Cb2/Db (2x)</lyrics>
