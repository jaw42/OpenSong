.Em7           D/F#      G
 There must be more than this
.C           Em7      D/F#        C
 O breath of God come breathe within
.Em7           D/F#      G
 There must be more than this

.          G             D/F#    
 Consuming fire fan into flame
.  Em7              C
 A passion for Your name
.          G                 D/F#                  Em7
 Spirit of God |Fall in this place |Lord have Your way
.               D       C       (ending D  G)
 Lord have Your way with us

[V2]
 Come like a rushing wind
 Clothe us with power from on high
 Now set the captives free
 Leave us abandoned to Your praise
 Lord let Your glory fall Lord let Your glory fall</lyrics></song>
