  <lyrics>[C]
 As bread that is broken
 Use our lives
 As wine that is poured out
 A willing sacrifice
 Empower us Father
 To share the love of Christ||
 As bread that is broken Lord
 Use our lives

[V1]
 Many hearts are hungry tonight
 Many trapped in darkness
 Yearn for the light
 So many who are far from home
 And many who are lost
 O Lord Your wounded children need||
 The power of Your cross

[V2]
 Help us to begin where we are
 Help us love the people
 Near to our hearts
 Then give our faith a mission field
 Wherever You may call
 Lord love Your world through each of us||
 Until we've touched them all</lyrics></song>
