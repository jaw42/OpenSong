.D    Bm     A  D  G        D
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!
.A/C#         Bm          A          E       A

 God in Three persons, blessed Trinity!
 
[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,
 Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
[V4]
 Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
 Which wert and art, and evermore shalt be.
 
[V5]
 Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide thee,
 Through the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,
[V6]
 Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
 Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
 
[V7]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth
 and sky and sea;
[V8]
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in Three persons, blessed Trinity!</lyrics></song>
