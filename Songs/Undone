  <lyrics>[C]
 To the cross I run
 Holding high my chains undone
 Now I am finally free
 Free to be what I've become
 Undone

[V1]
 No apologies
 For who I'm meant to be
 The only thing that matters is
 I am free
 When I am overwhelmed
 Holding pieces of my heart||
 When I feel my world
 Start to fall apart

[V2]
 Even in defeat
 The face of tragedy
 Still you'd have to say that
 I found victory
 In brokenness comes beauty
 Divine fragility||
 Reminding me of nail-scarred hands
 Reaching out for me

[BHallelujahI'mDone]</lyrics></song>
