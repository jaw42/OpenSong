.E            B/E          A/E         E    
 Sing to the  King Who is  coming to reign. 
.          B/E         A/E            E      
 Glory to  Jesus, the  Lamb that was  slain. 
.             B/E        A/E            E    
 Life and salvation His  empire shall bring, 
.                B/E            A/E       E     
 And joy to the  nations, when  Jesus is  King.

.E
 Come, let us sing a song, 
.   F#m7                               A2   
 A  song declaring that we belong to Jesus; 
.              E    D2
 He is all we  need   
.E                          
 Lift up a heart of praise. 
.F#m7                             A2   
 Sing now with voices raised to Jesus; 
.             E     
 Sing to the  King. 

[V2]
.E          B/E        A/E            E   
 For His returning we  watch and we pray; 
.            B/E        A/E           E    
 We will be  ready the  dawn of that  day. 
.               B/E           A/E         E     
 We'll join in  singing with  all the redeemed, 
.                 B/E             A/E       E     
 'Cause Satan is  vanquished and  Jesus is  King. </lyrics>
