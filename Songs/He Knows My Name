.G  D        A   D
 He knows my name
.G  D        A     D
 He knows my every thought
.G  D         A         Bm
 He sees each tear that falls
.    G        A      D
 And hears me when I call

[V1]
.D Em7    D G
 I have a Maker
.D  Dsus   D2 A
 He formed my heart
.D Em7       D      G
 Before even time began
.   D        A      D   Dsus
 My life was in His hands

[V2]
.D Em7    D  G
 I have a Father
.D  Dsus     D2  A
 He calls me His own
.D     Em7   D     G
 He'll never leave me.   
D      A       D  Dsus
 No matter where I go</lyrics>
