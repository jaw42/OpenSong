  <lyrics>[V1]
.D            A                  Em 
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness
.D         A            G
 Opened my eyes, let me see
[V2]
.D           A         Em 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You
.D         A              G
 Hope of a life spent with You
 
[C1]
.                D                     A
 So here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
.             D/F#               G
 Here I am to say that You're my God
[C2]
.                  D                  A
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
.           D/F#         G
 Altogether wonderful to me
 
[V3]
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above
[V4]
 Humbly You came to the earth You created
 All for love's sake became poor
 
[B]
.         A     D/F#     G
 And I'll never know how much it cost
.   A     D/F#  G
 To see my sin upon that cross (repeat)</lyrics></song>
