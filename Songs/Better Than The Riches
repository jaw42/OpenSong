  <lyrics>;Verse 1
[V1]
.G                      D 
 Better than the riches of this world
.Em                          C 
 Better than the sound of my friend's voices
[V2]
.G                       D 
 Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
.    Em              C 
 And that's just the start
 
;Verse 2
[V3]
.G                          A 
 Better than getting what I say I need
.Em                     C 
 Better than living the life that I want to
[V4]
.G                       D 
 Better than the love anyone can give
.Em        C 
 Your love is
 
;Pre-Chorus
[P1]
.        G       Am          G/B 
 And you hold me now in Your arms
.    C            D   Em  C 
 And never let me go
 
;Chorus
[C1]
.G                    D 
 You oh Lord make the sunshine
.        Em                C 
 And the moon light in the night sky
[C2]
.    G                  D 
 You give me breath and all Your love
.  Em               C 
 I give my heart to You because
[C3]
.G            D/F#                 Em 
 I can't stop falling in love with You
.                C                    Em   C  D 
 I'll never stop falling in love with You</lyrics></song>
