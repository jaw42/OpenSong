  <lyrics>[C]
 Than in Your arms of love
 In Your arms of love
 Holding me still
 Holding me near
 In Your arms of love

[V1]
 I sing a simple song of love
 To my Savior to my Jesus
 I'm grateful for the things You've done
 My loving Savior, oh precious Jesus
 
[B]
 My heart is glad that You've called me Your own
 And there's no place I'd rather be</lyrics>
