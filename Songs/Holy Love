  <lyrics>[C]
 Holy love flow in me
 Fill me up like the deepest sea
 Like a crashing wave
 Pouring over me
 Holy love flow in me

[V1]
 Many waters cannot quench Your love
 Rivers cannot overwhelm it
 Oceans of fear cannot conceal
 Your love for me
 Many waters cannot quench Your love
 Rivers cannot overwhelm it||
 Oceans of fear cannot conceal
 Your love for me
 Your love for me

[V2]
 Many sorrows cannot quench Your love
 Darkness cannot overwhelm it
 I will not fear
 Your love is here to comfort me
 Many sorrows cannot quench Your love
 Darkness cannot overwhelm it||
 I will not fear
 Your love is here to comfort me
 You comfort me

[B]
 When I find You I find healing
 When I find You I find peace
 And I know
 That there's no river so wide
 No mountain so high
 No ocean so deep||
 That You can't part the sea</lyrics></song>
