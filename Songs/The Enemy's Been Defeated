  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D
 The Enemy's been defeated
.E
 Death couldn't hold Him down
[V2]
.            D
 We're gonna lift our voice in victory
.      E
 Gonna sing Your praises loud
 
[V3]
 Shout out to God with a voice of triumph
 Shout out to God with a voice of praise
[V4]
 Shout out to God with a voice of triumph
 We lift Your name up, we lift Your name up</lyrics></song>
