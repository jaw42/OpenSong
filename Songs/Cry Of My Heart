  <lyrics>[C]
 It is the cry of my heart
 To follow You
 It is the cry of my heart
 To be close to You
 It is the cry of my heart
 To follow all of the days of my life||

[V1]
 Teach me Your holy ways oh Lord
 So I can walk in Your truth
 Teach me Your holy ways oh Lord
 And make me wholly devoted to You
 Oh oh whoa

[V2]
 Open my eyes so I can see
 The wonderful things that You do
 Open my heart up more and more
 And make it wholly devoted to You
 Oh oh whoa</lyrics></song>
