  <lyrics>[V1]
 Here I go, once again
 Running in circles, there is no end
 To my fears, to my doubts,
 I love You Lord, so why can't I

[C]
 Shout out loud, 
 to the ends of the earth
 Your love for us, 
 and Your hope for us
 Let us take our hands, take our feet
 Let us not hesitate
 to proclaim Your Name
 Lord, move me.

[V2]
 Give us courage, give us fire
 To proclaim Your glory, may our desire
 To know You more, to love You more
 Our God, our Savior, move us now...

[C2]
 Let us shout out loud, to the ends of the earth
 Your love for us, and Your hope for us 
 Let us take our hands, take our feet
 Let us not hesitate to proclaim Your Name
 Lord, move me.</lyrics></song>
