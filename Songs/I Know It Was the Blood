  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                          C               G
 I know it was the blood, I know it was the blood
.  G                          D
 I know it was the blood, for me.
[V2]
.    G                  C             G
 One day I was lost, He died upon the cross
.  G               D          G
 I know it was the blood, for me.
 
[V3]
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me
 Makes the lame to walk, and the blind to see
[V4]
 Opens prison's doors, sets the captives free
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me
 
[V5]
 Spring up oh well, within my soul
 Spring up oh well, and make me whole
[V6]
 Spring up oh well, within my soul
 Give me life, abundantly</lyrics></song>
