 O praise Him O praise Him
 He is holy
 He is holy yeah

[V1]
 Turn your ear to heaven
 And hear the noise inside
 The sound of angel's awe
 The sound of angel's songs
 And all this for a King
 We could join and sing||
 All to Christ the King
 How constant how divine
 This song of ours will rise
 O how constant how divine
 This love of ours will rise will rise

[V2]
 Turn your gaze to heaven
 And raise a joyous noise
 The sound of salvation come
 The sound of rescued ones
 And all this for a King
 Angels join to sing||
 All for Christ the King
 How infinite and sweet
 This love so rescuing
 O how infinitely sweet
 This great love that has redeemed
 As one we sing||

[C2]
 Alleluia alleluia
 He is holy
 He is holy yeah</lyrics></song>
