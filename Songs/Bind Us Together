  <lyrics>[C]
 Bind us together Lord
 Bind us together with cords
 That cannot be broken
 Bind us together Lord
 Bind us together Lord
 Bind us together with love||

[V1]
 There is only one God
 There is only one King
 There is only one body
 That is why we sing

[V2]
 Made for the glory of God
 Purchased by His precious Son
 Born with the right to be clean
 For Jesus the victory has won

[V3]
 You are the family of God
 You are the promise divine
 You are God's chosen desire
 You are the glorious new wine</lyrics></song>
