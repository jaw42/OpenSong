.E                                                A
 Well, I hear they're singing in the streets that Jesus is alive,
.    E                              A
 And all creation shouts aloud that Jesus is alive:
[V2]
.    E                                 A
 Now surely we can all be changed 'cos Jesus is alive:
.    E                            A    
 And everybody here can know that Jesus is alive.
 
[B1]
.   C#m                       A
 And I will live for all my days,
.           E                    B
 To raise a banner, of truth and light.
[B2]
.   C#m                     A
 To sing about my Saviour's love
.        E       
 And the best thing that happened
.        B
 Was the day I found You
 
[C]
.           E  A              E  A
 I've found Jesus, I've found Jesus,
.           E  A              E  A
 I've found Jesus, I've found Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Well, I feel like dancing in the streets 'cos Jesus is alive,
 To join with all who celebrate that Jesus is alive.
[V4]
 The joy of God is in this town 'cos Jesus is alive:
 For everybody's seen the truth that Jesus is alive.
 
[V5]
.         C#m 
 Well, you lifted me from where I was,
.A
 Set my feet upon a rock
.F#m                              A
 Humbled that You even knew about me.
[V6]
.    C#m
 Now I was chosen to believe,
.A
 Believing that You've chosen me:
[V7]
.F#m                        A
 I was lost but now I've found,
.           E  A
 I've found Jesus! </lyrics></song>
