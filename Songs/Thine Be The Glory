  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                   A
 Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,
.D                      G         A          D
 Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won.
[V2]
.D                A   Bm   Em               A
 Angels in bright garments rolled the stone away,
.Bm              E             Bm        E    A
 Kept the folded grave-clothes where thy body lay.
 
[C]
.D                   A
 Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,
.D                      G         A          D
 Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won.
 
[V3]
 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
 Lovingly he greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
[V4]
 Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,
 For her Lord now liveth, death has lost its sting.
 
[V5]
 No more we doubt thee, glorious Prince of life;
 Life is nought without thee; aid us in our strife:
[V6]
 Make us more than conquerors through thy deathless love
 Bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above.</lyrics></song>
