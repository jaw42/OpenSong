  <lyrics>[C]
 And You loved me before I knew You
 And You knew me for all time
 I've been created in Your image, O Lord
 And You bought me and You sought me||
 Your blood poured out for me
 A new creation in Your image, O Lord
 You rescued me You rescued me
 
[V1]
 You rescued me and picked me up
 A living hope of grace revealed
 A life transformed in righteousness
 O Lord You have rescued me
 
[V2]
 Forgiving me You healed my heart
 And set me free from sin and death
 You've brought me life You've made me whole
 O Lord You have rescued me</lyrics>
