  <lyrics>[C]
 Come unto me all who are weak
 Weary and heavy laden
 Gentle am I, humble in heart
 And you shall find rest 
 For your souls
 
[V1]
 All things are given unto
 Those who believe
 Princes and lowly ones, 
 His kingdom receive
 And just when I think that means
 Everyone but me
 Jesus comes beckoning to me
 
 
[V2]
 Enter the holy gates just as you are
 No need for a happy face
 Just come with your heart
 And Jesus will give us a joyful melody
 If only His calling we heed
 
[V3]
 We are His little ones, the children of God
 Children and fellow heirs
 Of His kingdom come
 We share the greatest love the world
 Has ever seen
 Here in the Lordâ€™s family</lyrics>
