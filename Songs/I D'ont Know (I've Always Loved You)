  <lyrics>[V1]
.C       G/B           F      
 I don't know how to explain it
.      F/E                   F  F/E  G 
 But I know that words would hardly do
[V2]
.C    G/B                  F 
 Miracles and signs and wonders
.        F/E             F     F/E    G 
 Aren't enough for Me to prove to you
 
[C1]
.  Am        F                 C 
   Don't you know I've always loved you
.  Am     F              C 
   Even before there was time
[C2]
.  Am         F              C  G/B   Am 
   Though you turned away, I tell you still
.            F         F/E     G 
   Don't you know I've always loved you
.               C   G/B  F  F/E  F  F/E  G 
   And I always will
 
[V3]
 Greater love has not a man
 Than the one who gives his life to prove
[V4]
 That he would do anything
 And that's what I'm going to do for you</lyrics></song>
