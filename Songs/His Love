  <lyrics>[V1]
 His love is higher
 Than the highest of mountains
 His love goes deeper
 Than the deepest of seas
 His love it stretches
 To the farthest horizon||
 And His love it reaches to me

[V2]
 His love is stronger
 Than the angels and demons
 His love it keeps me
 In my life's darkest hour
 His love secures me
 On the pathway to heaven||
 And His love is my strength and power

[V3]
 His love is sweeter
 Than the sweetest of honey
 His love is better
 Than the choicest of wine
 His love it satisfies
 The deepest of hunger||
 And His love in Jesus it's mine

[V4]
 Your love is sweeter
 Than the sweetest of honey
 Your love is better
 Than the choicest of wine
 Your love it satisfies
 The deepest of hunger||
 And Your love in Jesus it's mine

[V5]
 Your love is stronger
 Than the angels and demons
 Your love it keeps me
 In my life's darkest hour
 Your love secures me
 On the pathway to heaven||
 And Your love is my strength and power</lyrics></song>
