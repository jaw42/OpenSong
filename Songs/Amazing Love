  <lyrics>[C]
 Amazing love O what sacrifice
 The Son of God given for me
 My debt He pays and my death He dies
 That I might live that I might live

[V1]
 My Lord what love is this that pays so dearly
 That I the guilty one may go free

[V2]
 And so they watched Him die despised rejected
 But oh the blood He shed flowed for me

[V3]
 And now this love of Christ
 Shall flow like rivers
 Come wash your guilt away live again</lyrics></song>
