  <lyrics>[C]
 You bring times of refreshing
 You bring times of refreshing
 You bring times
 Of refreshing to my soul
 When I'm weary from the fight
 And trying to do what's right||
 You bring times
 Of refreshing to my soul

[V1]
 Well I thank You Lord
 That You are my Savior
 You're my strength and
 You're the rock
 On which I stand
 You give me life||
 And a grace that's greater
 When I humble myself
 Beneath Your mighty hand

[V2]
 For the day will come
 When we'll all be gathered
 And the sun will rise
 With healing in its wings
 And all the years of pain
 Won't seem to matter||
 When our eyes behold
 Our Teacher and our King</lyrics></song>
