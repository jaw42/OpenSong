.D               G
 Love songs from heaven
.    D           A
 Are filling the earth
.D              G           D   A
 Bringing great hope to all nations
[V2]

 Evil has prospered
.    D          A
 But truth is alive
[V3]
.D            G
 In this dark world
.    D     A     D
 The light still shines
 
[C1]
.A          D            A          D

 Through us may Jesus be seen
[C2]

 Nothing has silenced
 This gospel of Christ
 It echoes down through the ages
[V5]
 Blood of the martyrs
 Has made His church strong
[V6]
 In this dark world
 The light still shines
 
[V7]
 Let every nation
 Be filled with Your song
 This is the cry of Your people
[V8]
 We will not settle
 For anything less
[V9]
 In this dark world
 Our light must shine</lyrics></song>
