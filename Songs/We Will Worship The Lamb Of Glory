.                          B
 And with our hands lifted high
.        A           E
 We will worship and sing
.                          B
 And with our hands lifted high
.          A          E
 We come before You rejoicing||
.                      A           E
 With our hands lifted high to the sky
.         F#m           C#m
 When the world wonders why
.           A
 We'll just tell them
.      B          E
 We're loving our King
