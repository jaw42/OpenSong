  <lyrics>[V1]
 My peace I give unto you
 It's a peace
 That the world cannot give
 It's a peace
 That the world cannot understand
 Peace to know peace to live||
 My peace I give unto you

[V2]
 My love I give unto you
 It's a love
 That the world cannot give
 It's a love
 That the world cannot understand
 Love to know love to live||
 My love I give unto you</lyrics></song>
