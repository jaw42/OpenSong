  <lyrics>[V1]
 Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

[V1b]
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
 `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -
 Only this, and nothing more.'

[V2]
 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
 Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow

[V2b]
 From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
 Nameless here for evermore.

[V3]
 And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
 Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating

[V3b]
 `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
 This it is, and nothing more,'

[V4]
 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
 `Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,

[V4b]
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -
 Darkness there, and nothing more.

[V5]
 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
 But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,

[V5b]
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'
 Merely this and nothing more.

[V6]
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
 Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
 `Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;

[V6b]
 Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'

[V7]
 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
 Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;

[V7b]
 But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

[V8]
 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
 `Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.

[V8b]
 Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

[V9]
 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
 Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being

[V9b]
 Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
 Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
 With such name as `Nevermore.'

[V10]
 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
 Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -

[V10b]
 Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
 Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'

[V11]
 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
 `Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,
 Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster

[V11b]
 Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
 Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
 Of "Never-nevermore."'

[V12]
 But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
 Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking

[V12b]
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
 Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'

[V13]
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining

[V13b]
 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
 She shall press, ah, nevermore!

[V14]
 Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
 Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
 `Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee

[V14b]
 Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
 Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

[V15]
 `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
 Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
 Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -

[V15b]
 On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
 Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

[V16]
 `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
 By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
 Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,

[V16b]
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?'
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

[V17]
 `Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
 `Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
 Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!

[V17b]
 Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

[V18]
 And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,

[V18b]
 And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
 Shall be lifted - nevermore!</lyrics>
