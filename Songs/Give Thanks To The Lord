 Give thanks to the Lord, our God and King

 For He is good, He is above all things

 Sing praise, sing praise

 With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm
 His love endures forever
 For the life that's been reborn
 His love endures forever
 Sing praise, sing praise

 Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong

 By the grace of God, we will carry on
 His love endures forever
 Sing praise, sing praise</lyrics></song>
