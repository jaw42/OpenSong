  <lyrics>[C]
 Come to Me My people come
 There's no need to be afraid
 Of your Father
 When I see you will run
 I will be there
 I will be there||
 Before you call
 I will answer you
 While you still speak
 I will hear
 My ears are turned
 To the cry of My choosen ones||
 In My love you can rest in Me
 For you are My very own
 So hold on to the hope you have
 That I would draw you to Myself
 I will never leave you alone
 I will not forget you||
 I gather My lambs in My arms
 So I will comfort you
 And carry you close to My heart</lyrics></song>
