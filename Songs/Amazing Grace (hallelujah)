.D2                C
 Amazing grace  How sweet the sound,
.    G/B                 C
 that saved a wretch like me
.D2                 C
 I once was lost but now am found;
.   G/B             C
 was blind but now I see.
 
[C] 
 Hallelujah              
 Hallelujah Hallelu- (x4)
 Hallelujah
 
 
[V2] 
 Was grace that taught my heart to fear,
 and grace my fears relieved.
 How precious did that grace appear,
 the hour I first believed.
[V3] 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares,
 I have already come;
 â€™tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
 and grace will lead me home.
[V4]
 When we've been there ten thousand years,
 bright shining as the sun; 
 we've no less days to sing God's praise
 than when we first begun.</lyrics></song>
