.G     
 Lift up your heads, O you gates,
.               D           G
 Swing wide you everlasting doors.
[V2]
.             G
 Lift up your heads, O you gates,
.               D           G
 Swing wide you everlasting doors.
 
[C1]
.G                C     D        Em
 That the King of Glory may come in,
.                 C     D        G  
 That the King of Glory may come in.
[C2]
.                 C     D        Em
 That the King of Glory may come in,
.         G       C     D        G  C  D  G
 That the King of Glory may come in.
 
[V3]
 With trumpet blast and shouts of joy
 All heaven greets the risen King.
[V4]
 With angel choirs come line the way
 Throw wide the gates and welcome him.
 
[V5]
 Up from the dead he ascends,
 Through every rank of heavenly power;
[V6]
 Let heaven prepare the highest place,
 Throw wide the everlasting doors.</lyrics></song>
