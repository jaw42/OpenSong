  <lyrics>[V1]
 I've set my heart on You alone
 Cos You're the one I need
 There's no one else that takes the place of You
[V2]
 And after all is said and all is done
 We will be together
 But until then you know that I'm here for you
 
[V3]
 I want you more than ever
 All I want is to be with you
 I want you more than ever before
 
[V4]
 Every day and every night
 Makes my love grow more for you
 I feel your pain, I feel your sorrow and shame
[V5]
 And if I had to say a few last words
 They would be I love you
 But until then you know that I'm here for you
 
[V6]
 Just to be with you one day
 In your arms here to stay for ever
