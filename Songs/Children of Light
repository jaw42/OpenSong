  <lyrics>[C]
 Come, let us worship now.
 Let us kneel, let us humbly bow down.
 He is our God, we are his people,
 We are the cock in his care.
 So come let us bow.

[V1]
 We are the children of light.
 We are the children of day,
 So let us worship him in whom we have our being
 Until the coming of the Lord.

[V2]
 We are the children of God,
 Made in the image of Christ,
 And on the day he comes we shall be made like him
 For we shall see him as he is.

[V3]
 We are the soldiers of Christ,
 Dressed for the battle on high,
 So let us call on him for he will fight the battle
 And we will march with him on that day.

[V4]
 We are the faithful of God,
 We will endure 'til the end,
 So let us run the race that he has set before us
 To win the crown of righteousness.</lyrics></song>
