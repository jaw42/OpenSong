  <lyrics>[V1]
 Holy, You are still holy
 Even when the darkness surrounds my life
 Sovereign, You are still sovereign
 Even when confusion has blinded my eyes

[V2]
 Lord I don't deserve Your kind affection
 When my unbelief has kept me from Your touch
 I want my life to be a pure reflection
 Of Your Love

[C]
 So I come into Your chambers
 And I dance at Your feet, Lord
 You are my Savior
 And I'm at Your mercy
 All that has been in my life up to now
 Belongs to You
 For You are still holy
 Jesus, You are my King.</lyrics></song>
