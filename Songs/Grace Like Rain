 Amazing Grace
 How sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now I'm found
 Was blind but now I see so clearly
 Hallelujah||
 Grace like rain falls down on me
 Hallelujah
 All my stains are washed away
 Washed away
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved||
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed
 When we've been there
 Ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days||
 To sing Your praise
 Than when we first begun</lyrics></song>
