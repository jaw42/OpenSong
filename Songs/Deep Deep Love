  <lyrics>[C]
 Lord my heart is filled with praises
 For Your goodness makes me sing
 Jesus I'm forever grateful
 For Your love has done a work in me

[V1]
 Your deep deep love
 Washes over me
 Your deep deep love
 Fills my every need
 How I long to hear Your voice
 Call out my name||
 It draws me to
 Your deep deep love

[V2]
 Your deep deep love
 Cleanses all my sins
 Your deep deep love
 Brings a peace within
 How I long to hear Your voice
 Call out my name||
 It draws me to
 Your deep deep love</lyrics></song>
