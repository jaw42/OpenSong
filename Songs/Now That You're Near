  <lyrics>[V1]
 I stand before You Lord
 And give You all my praise
 Your love is all I need
 Jesus You're all I need

[V2]
 My life belongs to You
 You gave Your life for me
 Your grace is all I need
 Jesus You're all I need

[P]
 Hold me in Your arms
 Never let me go
 I want to spend eternity with You

[C]
 And now that You're near
 Everything is different
 Everything's so different Lord
 I know I'm not the same
 My life You've changed
 I want to be with You
 I want to be with You

[B]
 And I will sing for You always
 'Cause in Your presence God
 Is where I want to stay</lyrics></song>
