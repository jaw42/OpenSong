.C         Em F           G7
 Come unto me all who are weak
.C         Em    F   G7
 Weary and heavy la__den
.C         Em F         G7
 Gentle am I, humble in heart
.    F              G7            C
 And you shall find rest for your souls

[V1]
.F              C          F           C
 All things are given unto those who believe
.F           C               D       G
 Princes and lowly ones, His kingdom receive
.    F           G7
 And just when I think that means
.Em7          F
 Everyone but me
.F           G7           C
 Jesus comes beckoning to me

[V2]
 Enter the holy gates just as you are
 No need for a happy face
 Just come with your heart
 And Jesus will give us a joyful melody
 If only His calling we heed

[V3]
 We are His little ones, the children of God
 Children and fellow heirs
 Of His kingdom come
 We share the greatest love the world
 Has ever seen
 Here in the Lordâ€™s family</lyrics></main_settings>
