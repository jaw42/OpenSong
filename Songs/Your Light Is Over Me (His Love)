  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                                    A 
 Your light is over me, flooding over me
.
 The night is lifted
.E                             A
 Heaven over me, flooding over me
[V2]
.
 I can't contain it
.F#m        B
 My cup overflows
.F#m        B
 My cup overflows
 
[C1]
.           E         F#m    A
 Praise the Lord with all my heart
.B              E      F#m        A
 Praise Him for He has done great things;
[C2]
.    B           C#m   B         A
 His banner over me is love, His love
.    B           C#m   B         A
 His banner over me is love, His love
 
[T1]
.E                        F#m 
 You brought the sunshine in
.                       G#m
 And turned the dark to day
.                     A
 You made the shadows flee away;
[T2]
.E                F#m
 You opened up my eyes
.                    G#m
 To a new and living way 
.                 A
 The dawning of a brand new day</lyrics></song>
