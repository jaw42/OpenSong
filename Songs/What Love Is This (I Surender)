.G
 What love is this
.             Em
 That took my place
.           C
 Instead of wrath
[V2]
.                D
 You poured Your grace on me
.           G
 What can I do
[V3]
.           Em
 But simply come
.    C         D
 And worship You
 
[C]
.G    C   G   Em  C   D
 I surrender, I surrender
.G    C   G  C   D  G
 I surrender all to You
 
[V4]
 What love is this
 That comes to save
 Upon the cross
[V5]
 You bore my guilt and shame
 To You alone
[V6]
 I give my heart
 And worship You
 
[V7]
 A greater love
 No man has seen
 It breaks sin's power
[V7]
 And sets this prisoner free
 With all I have
[V8]
 And all I am
 I worship You</lyrics></song>
