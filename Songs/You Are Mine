  <lyrics>[V1]
.           E
 It doesn’t take much
.       B
 For my heart to break
[V2]
.             D 
 And You have done it
.         A                   E
 For what seems the millionth time
[V3]
 Whenever I hear
 Of Your saving grace
[V4]
 And how You gave Your life
 In exchange for mine
 
[C1]
.            B                   A      E
 Sometimes I wonder why You even love me
.            B                     A   E
 And why you ever chose to call me child
.
 Then I remember
[C2]
.             B
 It’s by Your sacrifice
.      D             A
 I can say that I am Yours 
.            E     G#, A, G#, E   D  C# A
 And You are mine
 
[V5]
 It doesn’t take much
 For me to shed a tear
[V6]
 And You have done so many things
 To make me cry
[V7]
 Whenever I think
 Of all that I’ve done wrong
[V8]
 And everything that You have done
 To make it right</lyrics></song>
