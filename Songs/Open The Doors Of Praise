.A        E        A    E
 Open the doors of praise
.A        E        A    E
 Open the doors of praise
[C2]
.A        E        A   
 Open the doors of praise
.    D       E         A
 And let the Lord come in
 
[V1]
.       E      A
 In the spirit world
.          E            A
 There's a battle going on
.       D          E
 And it rages endlessly
[V2]
.           E           F#m
 But in the name of the Lord
.       E            F#m
 We can stand on His word
.       D                   E
 For in Him, we have the victory
 
[V3]
 And the demons will flee
 As he said it would be
 And the skies, will ring with shouts of praise
[V4]
 And the Lord Jesus Christ
 Will be lifted high
 The Holy One, who truly saves
 
[B]
.E
 For He lives in the praises of His people
.
 (For He lives in the praises of His people)
 
 Here among us, to empower us
