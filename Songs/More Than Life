  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em       C              G
 Stand by everything You said
.Em           C           G
 Stand by the promises we made
[V2]
.Em         C              G
 Let go of everything I've done
.Em         C            G
 I'll run into Your open arms
.C         D
 And all I know...
 
[C]
.Em D/F# G  C         Em  G
 I love You more than life
.Em D/F# G  C         Em  G
 I love You more than life
 
[V3]
 Fall back on everything You've done
 Fall back on everlasting arms
[V4]
 When all the world is swept away
 You are all the things I need
 You're the air I breathe...
 
[B1]
.Am7        D
 How can it be
.             Em         C
 You were the One on the cross
.Am7        D       Em D/F# G
 Lifted for all our shame
[B2]
.Am7        D
 How can it be
.                  Em            C
 The scars in Your hands are for me
.Am7         D       G   D
 You are the King of all</lyrics></song>
