    The cross before me the world behind
.Em7
    No turning back raise the banner high
.Dsus
    It's not for me
.C2              G   Gsus G
    It's all for You ||
.G 
    Let the heavens shake and split the sky
.Em7
    Let the people clap their hands and cry 
.Dsus
    It's not for us
.C2              G   Gsus G
    It's all for You
 
[V2]
.G
    Our hearts unfold before Your throne
.Em7
    The only place for those who know
.Dsus
    It's not for us
.C2              G   Gsus G
    It's all for You ||
.G 
    Send Your holy fire on this offering
.Em7
    Let our worship burn for the world to see
.Dsus
    It's not for us
.C2              G   Gsus G
    It's all for You
