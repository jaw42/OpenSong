  <lyrics>[V1]
.    E           B   A/E      B/E
 How blessed was the precious life
.     E          Bsus  A/E      B/E
 Laid down at Calvar___y
.     E            B  A/E   B/E
 That took the sin of lowly man
.    E            B   A/E   B/E
 And nailed it to the tree
 
 
 
[C]
.    A    A2      E/G#                  C#m
 How blessed, how blessed (the blood of Jesus)
.B   A    A2  A                 E     B  A  B/A  E  B  A  B/A 
 How blessed    is the blood of Jesus
 
 
[V2]
.    E           B   A/E      B/E
 How blessed was the innocent Lamb
.     E           Bsus  A/E      B/E
 That uttered not a     sound
.    E             B  A/E     B/E
 Who chose instead to bow His head
.    E            B  A/E   B/E
 And bear the thorny crown
 
 
[V3]
.    E           B   A/E    B/E
 How blessed was the broken body   
.     E            Bsus  A/E      B/E
 That wore the scarlet   robe
.      E             B  A/E          B/E
 Who became the name by which we are saved
.   E           B   A/E   B/E
 In whom we put our hope

[B]
.E  G#m7    C#m            A
    And the pure redeeming blood
.                      E    Esus   E
 That flowed from Your side
.G#m7   C#m               A
 Is the sweet wine that's poured
.             F#m7    E/G#
 Out for Your bride
.                    A    B  Bsus  B
 It flowed from Your side</lyrics>
