  <lyrics>[C]
 Fall like fire soak like rain
 Flow like mighty waters
 Again and again|| 
 Sweep away the darkness
 Burn away the chaff
 And let a flame burn
 To glorify Your name
 
[V1]
 I will never be the same again
 I can never return
 I've closed the door|
 I will walk the path
 I'll run the race
 And I will never be the same again
 
[V2]
 There are higher heights
 There are deeper seas
 Whatever You need to do
 Lord do it in me|
 And the glory of God fills my life
 And I will never be the same again</lyrics>
