  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                        C
 Look what You've done for me 
.Em                    C  G
 Your blood has set me free
.D              C                         G
 Jesus my Lord, look what You've done for me
[V2]
.Em                 C
 I haven't been the same
.     Em                           C  G
 Ever since that day I called Your name
.D               C                         G
 Yahweh, Yahweh, look what You've done for me
 
[C1]
.               D      C       G
     What can I do for You, my Lord
.                  D        C        G
     I want You to know, my heart is Yours
[C2]
.               Em               C       D      G
     It's not a question of what You can do for me
.                   D      C       G
     But what can I do for You, my Lord
 
[V3]
 Up to Your cross I crawl
 Now I am standing ten feet tall
 Jesus my Saviour, look what You've done for me
[V4]
 Free at last, I'm free
 I owe You my life completely
 Yahweh, Yahweh, what do You want from me?</lyrics></song>
