  <lyrics>[C]
 In the house of the Lord
 Where Your children come
 To dance and sing
 In the house of the Lord
 We rejoice in all
 The things You've done||

[V1]
 We have come to celebrate
 We have come to sing
 Of Your great power
 And the glory of Your name
 You have set the captives free
 You have made the blind eyes see||
 To the poor
 You have proclaimed good news

[V2]
 We have come to worship You
 To give praise and thanks to You
 Knowing that You've only just begun
 You have touched us by Your grace
 Lord we long to see Your face
 To be with You through all eternity||

[T]
 We rejoice we rejoice
 We rejoice in all the things You've done</lyrics></song>
