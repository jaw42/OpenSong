  <lyrics>[V1]
.Asus      A    Asus       A
 There's a place where the streets shine,
.Asus     A     E      A
 With the glory of the Lamb.
[V2]
.Asus      A   Asus       A
 There's a way, we can go there,
.Asus   A          E      A
 We can live there beyond time.
 
[C1]
.           E
 Because of You,
.           A
 Because of You,
[C2]
.                E
 Because of Your love,
.                A
 Because of Your blood,
 
[V3]
 No more pain, no more sadness,
 No more suffering, no more tears,
[V4]
 No more sin, no more sickness,
 No injustice, no more death.
 
[B1]
.        D
 All our sins are washed away
.    A
 And we can live forever.
.E
 Now we have this hope
[B2]
.           A
 Because of You.
.          D
 Oh, we'll see you face to face
.    A
 And we will dance together
[B3]
.       E
 In the city of our God
.           A  Asus  A
 Because of You
 
[V5]
 There is joy everlasting,
 There is gladness, there is peace.
[V6]
 There is wine ever flowing,
 There's a wedding, there's a feast.</lyrics></song>
