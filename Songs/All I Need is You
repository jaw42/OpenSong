  <lyrics>;Verse 1
[V1]
.C#m                 F#m
 Left my fear by the side of the road
.A               B
 Hear You speak, won't let go
.C#m                    E                B
 Fall to my knees, as I lift my hands to pray
[V2]
.C#m                    F#m
 Got every reason to be here again
.A                  B
 Father's love that draws me in
.   C#m                E                   B
 And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You
 
[C1]
.             F#m A
 All I need is You
.              E
 All I need is You, Lord
.   B
 Is You Lord
[C2]
.             F#m A
 All I need is You
.              E
 All I need is You, Lord
.   B
 Is You Lord
 
;Verse 2
[V3]
 One more day, and it's not the same
 Your Spirit calls my heart to sing
 Drawn by the voice of my Saviour once again
[V4]
 Where would my soul be without Your Son
 Gave His life to save the earth
 Rest in the thought that You're watching over me
 
;Bridge
[B1]
.     F#m      A
 All I need is You
.      E       B
 All I need is You
[B2]
.     F#m      A
 All I need is You
.      E       B
 All I need is You
 
[T1]
.    A  E     B    F#m
 You hold the universe
.    A  E     B         F#m
 You hold everyone on earth
[T2]
.    A  E     B    F#m
 You hold the universe

 You hold, You hold</lyrics></song>
