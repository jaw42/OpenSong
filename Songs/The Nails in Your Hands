  <lyrics>[V]
.    E
 The nails in Your hands,
.    C#m
 The nail in Your feet,
.     A                    B
 They tell me how much You love me;||
.    E
 The thorns on Your brow,
.C#m
 They tell me how,
.    A                     B
 You bore so much shame to love me.
 
[P]
.             G#m           C#m
 And when the heavens pass away,
.         G#m                C#m
 All Your scars will still remain,
.       G#m            C#m              B
 And forever they will say how much You love me,
 
 And I want to say...
[C]
 
.    E
 "Forever my love,
.   C#m
 Forever my heart,
.   A               B      E
 Forever my life is Yours."</lyrics>
