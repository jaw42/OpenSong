.D           G             D  A   D
 We sing our praise to the Living God

 There is no-one higher than You

 All that I am shall praise Your name
.G       A     D
 In this place today
 
[V1]
.G   D       A           D
 You are the Alpha and Omega
.G   D       Bm            A
 You are the First and the Last
[V2]
.G   D       A         B
 You are the Sovereign Ruler

 You are the King of Kings
 You are the Lord of Lords
[V4]
 You are the One Messiah
 And we give You praise

 You are the One who was
 Who is, and is to come
[V6]
 The Way, the Truth, and the Life
 And we give You all our praise
