 Let us sing now every one
 Let us feel His love begun

 Melting our hearts as one
 By God's Spirit we are united
 One thru His blessed Son||

 Now dear Lord we join in worship
 Thank You for all You've done
 Thank You for this love You gave us
 Thank You for making us one||

 We are one in the bond of love</lyrics>
