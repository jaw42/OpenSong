  <lyrics>[C]
 Show Your power oh Lord our God
 Show Your power oh Lord our God
 Oh Lord our God

[C2]
 Send Your power oh Lord our God
 Send Your power oh Lord our God
 Oh Lord our God

[V1]
 He is the Lord
 And He reigns on high
 He is the Lord
 Spoke into the darkness
 Created the light
 He is the Lord||

[V2]
 Who is like unto Him
 Never ending in days
 He is the Lord
 And He comes in power
 When we call on His name
 He is the Lord||

[V3]
 Your gospel oh Lord
 Is the hope for our nation
 You are the Lord
 It's the power of God
 For our salvation
 You are the Lord||

[V4]
 We ask not for riches
 But look to the cross
 You are the Lord
 And for our inheritance
 Give us the lost
 You are the Lord||</lyrics></song>
