  <lyrics>[V1]
.C      D     G
 Father of creation,
.C           D         G
 Unfold Your sovereign plan.
.C          D          Em 
 Raise up a chosen generation
[V2]
.C                           D
 That will march through the land.
.C         D        G
 All of creation is longing
.C          D          G
 For Your unveiling of power.
[V3]
.C          D             Em 
 Would You release Your anointing
.C                     D
 O God let this be the hour.
 
[C1]
.         G     D/F#         Em 
 Let Your glory fall in this room,
.       C                         D
 Let it go forth from here to the nations.
[C2]
.         G         D/F#         Em 
 Let Your fragrance rest in this place,
.      C         D         G
 As we gather to seek Your face.
 
[V4]
 Ruler of the nations,
 The world has yet to see.
[V5]
 The full release of Your promise,
 The church in victory.
[V6]
 Turn to us Lord and touch us,
 Make us strong in Your might.
[V7]
 Overcome our weakness
 That we may stand up and fight.
 
[B1]
 Let Your kingdom come, (Echo)
 Let Your will be done,  (Echo)
[B2]
 Let us see on earth   (Echo)
 The glory of Your Son.
