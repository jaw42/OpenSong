  <lyrics>[V1]
.     G                 D/F#            Em
 For You are good, Your love endures forever
.    C             G/B             D
 And we rejoice in Your unfailing love.
.    G                   D/F#            Em
 Consume our praise with fire down from heaven
.     C                G/B          D
 And fill us with Your power from above.

[C]
.  G D    C D    G D
 Arise, arise, arise
.    C         D     G
 Oh Lord, our God, arise!

[V2]
.  G                 D
 Arise, oh Lord, within our midst
.   C      G         D        G
 As we declare Your righteousness;
.     G                D
 Lift up the name that we confess
.   C       G         D   G
 As we proclaim Your holiness.

[V3]
 Salvation comes from You alone
 Oh Lamb of God, the chosen One.
 That we might be Your resting place
 We worship You, we seek Your face.
