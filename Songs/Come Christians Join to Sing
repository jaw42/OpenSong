  <lyrics>[V1]
 Come Christians join to sing
 Alleluia amen
 Loud praise to Christ our King
 Alleluia amen||
 Let all with heart and voice
 Before His throne rejoice
 Praise is His gracious choice
 Alleluia amen
 
[V2]
 Come lift your hearts on high
 Alleluia amen
 Let praises fill the sky
 Alleluia amen||
 He is our Guide and Friend
 To us He'll condescend
 His love shall never end
 Alleluia amen
 
[V3]
 Praise yet our Christ again
 Alleluia amen
 Life shall not end the strain
 Alleluia amen||
 On heaven's blissful shore
 His goodness we'll adore
 Singing forevermore
 Alleluia amen</lyrics>
