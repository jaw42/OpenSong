.  C              F         C
 O God of burning cleansing flame
.         G
 Send the fire
.     C                   F      C
 Your blood bought gift today we claim
[V2]
.F        G      C
 Send the fire today
.     G                 F       C
 Look down and see this waiting Host
.    G                 F    C
 And send the promised Holy Ghost
[V3]
.   Am           G    C
 We need another Pentecost
.F        G      C   Am
 Send the fire today
.F        G      C
 Send the fire today
 
[V4]
 God of Elijah hear our cry
 Send the fire
[V5]
 And make us fit to live or die
 Send the fire today
[V6]
 To burn up every trace of sin
 And bring the light and glory in
[V7]
 The revolution now begin
 Send the fire today
 Send the fire today
 
[V8]
 It's fire we want for fire we plead
 Send the fire
[V9]
 The fire will met our every need
 Send the fire today
[V10]
 For strength to always do what's right
 And grace to conquer in the fight
 For power to walk the world in white
[V11]
 Send the fire today
 Send the fire today
 
[V12]
 To make our weak heart strong and brave
 Send the fire
[V13]
 To live a dying world to save
 Send the fire again
[V14]
 Now see us on Your alter lay
 Our lives, our all this very day
 To crown the offering now we pray
[V15]
 Send the fire today
 Send the fire today</lyrics></song>
