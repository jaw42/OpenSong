 God's way is the best way
 God's way is the right way
 I'll trust in him always
 He knoweth the best

[V1]
 God's way is the best way
 Tho' I may not see
 Why sorrows and trials
 Oft gather 'round me
 He ever is seeking
 My gold to refine||
 So humbly I trust Him
 My Savior divine

[V2]
 God's way is the best way
 My path He hath planned
 I'll trust in Him always
 While holding His hand
 In shadow or sunshine
 He ever is near||
 With Him for my refuge
 I never need fear

[V3]
 God's way shall be my way
 He knoweth the best
 And leaning upon Him
 Sweet sweet is my rest
 No harm can befall me
 Safe safe shall I be||
 I'll cling to Him ever
 So precious is He</lyrics></song>
