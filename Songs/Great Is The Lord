  <lyrics>[C]
 Great is the Lord
 He is holy and just
 By His power we trust in His love
 Great is the Lord
 He is faithful and true
 By His mercy He proves He is love||

[V1]
 Great is the Lord
 And worthy of glory
 Great is the Lord
 And worthy of praise
 Great is the Lord
 Now lift up your voice||
 Now lift up your voice
 Great is the Lord

[V2]
 Great are You Lord
 And worthy of glory
 Great are You Lord
 And worthy of praise
 Great are You Lord
 I lift up my voice||
 I lift up my voice
 Great are You Lord

[T]
 Great are You Lord
 Great are You Lord
 Great are You Lord
 Great are You Lord</lyrics></song>
