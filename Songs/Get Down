  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm                             D
 Lavishly our lives are wasted, humbleness is left untasted,
.G                                      D
 You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah;
.Bm                              D
 That's a tip from my mistake, exactly what it doesn't take,
.   G                              Bm     A
 To win you've got to come in last place.
.   D                     E7                  G              D
 To live your life you've got to lose it, And all the losers get a crown.

[C]
.      D                               E7
 I get down, and He lifts me up, I get down, and He lifts me up,
.      G                               D
 I get down, and He lifts me up, I get down.

[V2]
.Bm                             D
 All I need's another day where I can't seem to get away
.G                                 D
 From the many things that drag me down, yeah;
.    Bm                                  D
 I'm sure you've had a day like me where nothing seems to set you free,
.         G                            Bm    A
 From the burdens you can't carry all alone.
.D                E7              G                D
 In your weakness He is stronger, In your darkness He shines through;
.D                  E7                             G              D
 When you're crying He's your comfort, When you're all alone He's carrying you.

[B]
.D           E7          G                    D    D         E7              G                   D
 This valley is so deep, I can barely see the sun; I cry out for mercy Lord, And You lift me up again.</lyrics></song>
