C He is jealous for me. Am7 Loves like a hurricane,| I am a tree. G                                          Fmaj7 Bending beneath| the weight of his wind and mercy||.      C When all of a sudden.                       Am7 I am unaware of these| Afflictions eclipsed by glory.       G And I realize just how beautiful you are.         Fmaj7 And how great your affections are for me[C]. C                   Am7 Oh how He loves us so.            G Oh how He loves us.                 Fmaj7 How He loves us so. C Am7 G Fmaj7 (2x)[C2].        C Yeah He loves us.           Am7 Oh how He loves us.           G Oh how he loves us,.         Fmaj7 Oh how he loves![C3]. That he loves us,.           Am7 Oh how He loves us.           G Oh how he loves us,.         Fmaj7 Oh how he loves![V2] .   C So we are his portion and he is our prize,. Am7 Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,.   G                           Fmaj7 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking.||.   C So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,.       Am7 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest..  G                                                Fmaj7 I don't have time to maintain these regrets when I think about the way..</lyrics></song>
