[V1]

 Set this place on fire

 Send your Spirit, Savior
[V2]

 Rescue from the mire

 Show your servant favor

 Yesterday was the day that I was alone

 Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God

[C1]
.        E    C       G         D
 Yes our God, He is a consuming fire

 And the flames burn down deep in my soul
[C2]

.Bm       D             A                      Em
 Did you realise that inside of you there is a flame
[B2]
.Bm      D                  A
 Did you ever try to let it burn

 Let it burn, let it burn?

 And yes our God, He is a consuming fire
.        E      C         A
 And the flames burn down deep in my soul</lyrics></song>
