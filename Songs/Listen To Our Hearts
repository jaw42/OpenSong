  <lyrics>[C]
 So listen to our hearts
 Hear our spirit sing
 A song of praise that flows
 From those You have redeemed
 We will use the words we know
 To tell You what an awesome God You are||
 But words are not enough
 To tell You of our love
 So listen to our hearts

[V1]
 How do you explain
 How do you describe
 A love that goes from east to west
 And runs as deep as it is wide
 You know all our hopes
 Lord You know all our fears||
 And words cannot express
 The love we feel
 But we long for You to hear

[V2]
 If words could fall like rain
 From these lips of mine
 And if I had a thousand years
 I would still run out of time
 So if You'll listen to my heart
 Every beat will say||
 Thank You for the life
 Thank You for the truth
 Thank You for the way</lyrics></song>
