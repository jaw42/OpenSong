.           D              A                 G                 D
1Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
2Here I raise mine Ebenezer, Hither by Thy great help I come;
3Oh to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;
 
.           D            A                 G                D
1Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.
2And I hope by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.
3Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
 
.         D              A               G               D
1Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;
2Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
3Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
 
.           D                 A                G             D
1Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, Mount of Thy redeeming love.
2He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.
3Here's my heart, Oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.</lyrics>
