 Word of God speak
 Would You pour down like rain
 Washing my eyes to see Your majesty
 To be still and know
 That You're in this place
 Please let me stay and rest||
 In Your holiness
 Word of God speak

[V1]
 I'm finding myself at a loss for words
 And the funny thing is it's okay
 The last thing I need is to be heard
 But to hear what You would say

[V2]
 I'm finding myself in the midst of You
 Beyond the music beyond the noise
 All that I need is to be with You
 And in the quiet hear Your voice

[T]
 I'm finding myself at a loss for words
 And the funny thing is it's okay</lyrics></song>
