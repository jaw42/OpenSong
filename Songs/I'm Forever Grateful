  <lyrics>[C]
 And I'm forever grateful to You
 I'm forever grateful
 For the cross
 I'm forever grateful to You
 That You came
 To seek and save the lost||

[V1]
 You did not wait for me
 To draw near to You
 But You clothed Yourself
 With frail humanity
 You did not wait for me
 To cry out to You||
 But You let me hear
 Your voice calling me</lyrics></song>
