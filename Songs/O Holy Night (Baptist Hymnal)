 Oh night divine
 Oh night when Christ was born
 Oh night divine
 Oh night, oh night divine!

[V1]
 O holy night!
 the stars are brightly shining
 It is the night 
 of the dear Savior's birth!
 Long lay the world 
 in sin and error pining
 Till He appeared, gift of infinite worth!||
 Behold the Babe in yonder manger lowly
 'Tis God's own Son come down in human form:
 Fall on your knees
 Before the Lord most holy!

[V2]
 With humble hearts
 we bow in adoration
 Before this child, 
 gift of God's matchless love,
 Sent from on high
 to purchase our salvation
 That we might dwell with Him ever above.||
 What grace untold
 to leave the bliss of glory
 And die for sinners
 guilty and forlorn:
 Fall on your knees
 Repeat the wondrous story!

[V3]
 O day of joy,
 when in eternal splendor
 He shall return 
 in His glory to reign
 When ev'ry tongue
 due praise to Him shall render,
 His pow'r and might to all nations proclaim!||
 A thrill of hope
 our longing heart rejoices,
 For soon shall dawn
 that glad eternal morn:
 Fall on your knees
 with joy lift up your voices!
