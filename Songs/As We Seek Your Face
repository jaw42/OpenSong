  <lyrics>[V1]
 As we seek Your face
 May we know Your heart
 Feel Your presence acceptance
 As we seek Your face

[V2]
 Move among us now
 Come reveal Your power
 Show Your presence acceptance
 Move among us now

[V3]
 At Your feet we fall
 Sov'reign Lord
 We cry holy holy
 At Your feet we fall</lyrics></song>
