.G    D       C          D        G 
 Over all the earth, You reign on high

 Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
[V2]
.       D     C              D    Am 
 But my one request, Lord my only aim
.            C        D     G 
 Is that You reign in me again
 
[C1]
.                C         D       G 
   Lord reign in me, reign in Your power
.       D      C             D      Em 
   Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
[C2]
.      D       C       D     Am 
   You are the Lord of all I am
.               C        D   G   D CE  G 
   So won't You reign in me again
 
[V3]
 Over every thought, over every word
 May my life reflect the beauty of the Lord
[V4]
 You mean more to me than any earthly thing
 So won't You reign in me again</lyrics></song>
