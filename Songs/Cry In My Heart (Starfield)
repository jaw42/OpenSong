[V1]
.D
 There's a cry in my heart
.A/C#
 For your glory to fall
.Em7                          Asus  A
 For your presence to fill up my senses
.D
 There's a yearning again
.A/C#
 A thirst for discipline
.Em7                             Asus A
 A hunger for things that are deeper


[P1]
.Bm                  G
 Could you take me beyond
.D                     A/C#
 Could you carrry me through
.Bm                G
 If I opened my heart
.D                     A/C#
 Could I go there with You


[C1]
.                G
 For what do I have
.                     D
 If I don't have you Jesus
.               A/C#
 What in this life
.               Bm
 Could mean anymore
.            G
 You are my rock
.              D
 You are my glory
.            A/C#   G     Bm  Asus A
 You are the lifter of my head

.Bm                  G
 Could you take me beyond
.D                     A/C#
 Could you carrry me through
.Bm                G
 If I opened my heart
.D                     A/C#
 Could I go there with You
.Bm                    G
 For I've been here before
.      D                  A/C#
 Yet I know there's still more
.Em                      A/C# Asus A
 O Lord, I need to know you


[C1]

 For what do I have

 If I don't have you Jesus
.               A/C#
 What in this life
.               Bm
 Could mean anymore

 You are my rock
.              D
 You are my glory
.            A/C#   G     Bm
 You are the lifter of my head
