  <lyrics>[V1]
 Single-minded, whole-hearted
 One thing I ask

[V2]
 That I may gaze upon Your beauty oh Lord
 That I may seek Your holy face
 That I may know You in an intimate way
 And follow after You all of my days
 And follow after You all of my days

[C]
 All of life comes down
 To just one thing
 And that's to know You oh Jesus
 And make You known</lyrics>
