.D/F#   G        D                 A
 I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken
.D/F#  G       A
 I'm accepted, You were condemned
[V2]
.D/F#    G                    D           A
 And I'm alive and well, 
.
 Your Spirit is within me
.  G         A              D
 Because You died and rose again
 
[C1]
.  D             G
   Amazing love, how can it be
.  D                              A
   That You my King would die for me
[C2]
.  D             G
   Amazing love, I know it's true
.  D                     A
   It's my joy to honour You
.           G   A        D
   In all I do, I honour You
