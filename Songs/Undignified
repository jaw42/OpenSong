  <lyrics>[C]
 And I'll become even more
 Undignified than this
 Some would say it's foolishness but
 I'll become even more
 Undignified than this

[V1]
 I will dance I will sing
 To be mad for my King
 Nothing Lord is hindering
 The passion in my soul

[T]
 Na na na na na na hey
 Na na na na na na hey</lyrics></song>
