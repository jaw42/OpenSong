  <lyrics>[C]
 Joy to the world
 He is risen alleluia
 He is risen alleluia
 He is risen alleluia alleluia

[V1]
 Hear the bells ringing they're singing
 That you can be born again
 Hear the bells ringing they're singing
 Christ is risen from the dead
 The angels up on the tombstone
 Said He is risen just as He said||
 Quickly now go tell His disciples
 That Jesus Christ is no longer dead</lyrics></song>
