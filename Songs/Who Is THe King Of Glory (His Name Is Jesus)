  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D                            Bm 
 Who is this King of glory, that pursues me with His love
.    D                                  Bm 
 And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words
[V2]
.   G                            Bm 
 My conscience a reminder, of forgiveness that I need
.    A                     G                D
 Who is this King of glory who offers it to me
 
[V3]
 Who is this King of angels, O blessed Prince of Peace
 Revealing things of heaven and all its mysteries
[V4]
 My spirit's ever longing for His grace in which to stand
 Who is this King of Glory, Son of God and Son of Man
 
[C]
.              G               Bm 
   His name is Jesus, precious Jesus
.            Am                     G
   The Lord Almighty, the King of my heart
.              D
   The King of Glory
 
[V5]
 Who is this King of Glory with strength and majesty
 And wisdom beyond measure, the gracious King of Kings
[V6]
 The Lord of Earth and Heaven, the Creator of all things
 Who is this King of Glory, He's everything to me</lyrics></song>
