  <lyrics>[C]
 For I know that my Redeemer lives
 And I will stand with Him on that day
 
[V1]
 For I know my Redeemer lives
 And in the end He will stand on the earth
 For I know my Redeemer lives
 And in the end He will reign on the earth
 Though my flesh it be destroyed
 Yet with my eyes I will see God
 
[V2]
 Oh my heart it yearns within me
 For the day when Jesus returns
 Oh my heart it yearns within me
 For the day when Jesus shall reign
 Though my flesh it be destroyed
 Yet with my eyes I will see God</lyrics>
