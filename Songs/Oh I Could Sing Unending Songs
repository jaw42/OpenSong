  <lyrics>[C1]
.    D            A
 Oh, I could sing unending songs
.   Bm               G
 Of how you saved my soul.
[C2]
.     D               A
 Well I could dance a thousand miles
.  Bm                  G
 Because of Your great love.   (x2)
 
[V1]
.D 
 My heart is bursting, Lord,
.A
 To tell of all You've done.
.Bm                             G              A
 Of how You changed my life and wiped away the past.
[V2]
.D  
 I wanna shout it out,
.A
 From every roof top sing.
.Bm                         G             A
 For now I know that God is for me not against me.
 
[B1]
.G
 Everybody's singing now,
.              D
 'Cos we're so happy!
[B2]
.G
 Everybody's dancing now,
.              D
 'Cos we're so happy!
[B3]
.   Em
 If only we could see Your face
.    G
 And see You smiling over us
[B4]
.    Em                    G
 And unseen angels celebrate.
.                   D
 For joy is in this place!
