  <lyrics>[C]
 And I thank You thank You Lord
 Thank You thank You Lord
 Thank You for loving
 And setting me free
 Thank You for giving
 Your life just for me||
 How I thank You
 Jesus I thank You
 Gratefully thank You
 Thank You

[V1]
 For all that You've done
 I will thank You
 For all that You're going to do
 For all that You've promised
 And all that You are
 Is all that has carried me through||
 Jesus I thank You</lyrics></song>
