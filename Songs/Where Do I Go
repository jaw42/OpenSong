  <lyrics>[C]
 Where do I go when I need a shelter
 Where do I go when I need a friend
 Where do I go when I need some helping
 Where do I go
 Back on my knees again

[V1]
 Ask me this question
 I'll tell you no lies
 How did I get this fire in my life
 All is not certain but I will get by
 Listen I'll tell you why

[V2]
 Sure as the winter comes after the fall
 Sure as true love tears down any wall
 Oh my Jesus is able to carry it all
 He will answer our call</lyrics></song>
