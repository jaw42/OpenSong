  <lyrics>;Verse 1
[V1]
.C G   F    G    C              F    G   C
 All I once held dear, built my life upon,
.         F     G   C       Am      G
 All this world reveres and wars to own,
[V2]
.      F    G       C           F   G   C
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss;
.          Am   F    C       Am       G
 Spent and worthless now, compared to this.
 
;Chorus
[C1]
.        F    C
 Knowing You, Jesus,
.F       C
 Knowing You,
.      Am    G       F
 There is no greater thing.
[C2]
.          C               F
 You're my all, You're the best,
.          C            F
 You're my joy, my righteousness,
.      C        Am
 And I love You Lord.
 
;Verse 2 
[V3]
 Now my heart's desire is to know You more,
 To be found in You and known as Yours.
[V4]
 To possess by faith what I could not earn,
 All-surpassing gift of righteousness.
 
;Verse 3
[V5]
 Oh, to know the power of Your risen life,
 And to know You in Your sufferings.
[V6]
 To become like you in your death, my Lord,
 So with you to live and never die.</lyrics></song>
