  <lyrics>[V1] 
 Oh, to see the dawn
 Of the darkest day:
 Christ on the road to Calvary.
 Tried by sinful men,
 Torn and beaten, then
 Nailed to a cross of wood.
 
[C1]
 This, the pow'r of the cross:
 Christ became sin for us;
 Took the blame, bore the wrath-
 We stand forgiven at the cross.
 
[V2]
 Oh, to see the pain
 Written on Your face,
 Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
 Ev'ry bitter thought,
 Ev'ry evil deed
 Crowning Your bloodstained brow. 
 
[V3]
 Now the daylight flees;
 Now the ground beneath
 Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
 Curtain torn in two,
 Dead are raised to life;
 "Finished!" the vict'ry cry. 
 
[V4]
 Oh, to see my name
 Written in the wounds,
 For through Your suffering I am free.
 Death is crushed to death;
 Life is mine to live,
 Won through Your selfless love.
 
[C2]
 This, the pow'r of the cross:
 Son of God - slain for us.
 What a love! What a cost! 
 We stand forgiven at the cross.
