  <lyrics>[C]
 Be of good cheer
 Be of good cheer
 For I have overcome the world
 Be of good cheer
 Be of good cheer

[V1]
 For peace be unto you
 My peace I give to you
 In this world you'll surely find
 Trials of many different kinds
 But

[V2]
 For now I go away
 But I will reutrn
 To take you to a place to dwell
 So where I am
 You'll be as well

[B]
 In this world you'll surely find
 Trials of many different kinds
 But I will not forsake you then
 I'll be with you until the end</lyrics></song>
