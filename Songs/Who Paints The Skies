.G                         D        G
 Who paints the skies into glorious day
.G                     D  G
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
.G                          D        G
 Who breathes His life into fists of clay
[V2]
.G                     D  G
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
.G                          D          G
 Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain
.G                     D  G
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
[V3]
.G                       D     G
 Who makes the desert to live again
.G                     D   G
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
 
[B]
.D               G          C          D
 Ooh teach every nation His marvellous ways,
.D            G            C        D  
 Ooh each generation shall sing His praise.
 
[C1]
.G                      C    D
 He is wonderful, He is glorious,
.                          C          D      G
 Clothed in righteousness, full of tenderness.
[C2]
.                               C         D
 Come and worship Him, He's the Prince of life,
.                         C        D        G  C  G  D  
 He will cleanse our hearts in His river of fire.
 
[V4]
 Who hears the cry of the barren one
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone
[V5]
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Who storms the prison and sets men free
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
[V6]
 Purchasing souls for eternity
 Only the mercy of Jesus.</lyrics></song>
