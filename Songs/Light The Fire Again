  <lyrics>[C]
 I am here to buy gold
 Refined in the fire
 Naked and poor
 Wretched and blind I come
 Clothe me in white
 So I won't be ashamed||
 Lord light the fire again

[V1]
 Don't let my love grow cold
 I'm calling out
 Light the fire again
 Don't let my vision die
 I'm calling out
 Light the fire again||

[V2]
 You know my heart my deeds
 I'm calling out
 Light the fire again
 I need Your discipline
 I'm calling out
 Light the fire again||</lyrics></song>
