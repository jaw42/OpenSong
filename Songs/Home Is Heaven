.E                           B       C#m     B       A
 Into Your courts I run with praises flowing from my heart
.E                            B             C#m    B     A
 Every day I wake I sing Your song, its the anthem of my life
[B1]
.        B                    C#m             
 I wanna spend my days in Your presence Lord,

 Bowed before Your throne
[B2]
.       B                     C#m                 
 In the house of God is where I find my peace,

 Home is Heaven, one day Lord I will live

 In your courts You'll find me in worship at Your feet
.        B    C#m
 Hide me now
[C2]
.       A              E 
 In the shadow of Your wings

 Where I will be

 Where I will be
 
.E  F#m  A  x2

 Your love is all I need so desperately, I have sought Your face
 I know You hear my every cry and petition that I make
