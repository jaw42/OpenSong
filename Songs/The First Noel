 Noel Noel Noel Noel
 Born is the King of Israel
 
[V1]
 The first Noel the angel did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep
 
[V2]
 They looked up and saw a star
 Shining in the east beyond them far
 And to the earth it gave great light
 And so it continued both day and night
 
[V3]
 And by the light of that same star
 Three wise men came from country far
 To seek for a king was their intent
 And to follow the star wherever it went
 
[V4]
 This star drew nigh to the northwest
 O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
 And there it did both stop and stay
 Right over the place where Jesus lay
 
[V5]
 Then entered in those wise men three
 Full rev'rently upon their knee
 And offered there in His presence
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense
 
[V6]
 Then let us all with one accord
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
 That hath made heav'n and earth of naught
 And with His blood mankind hath bought</lyrics>
