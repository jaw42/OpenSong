  <lyrics>[v1]
 There is a green hill far away,
 Outside a city wall,
 Where the dear Lord was crucified,
 Who died to save us all.
[v2]
 We may not know, we cannot tell,
 What pains He had to bear;
 But we believe it was for us
 He hung and suffered there.
[v3]
 He died that we might be forgiv’n,
 He died to make us good,
 That we might go at last to Heav’n,
 Saved by His precious blood.
[v4]
 There was no other good enough
 To pay the price of sin;
 He only could unlock the gate
 Of heaven and let us in.
[v5]
 O dearly, dearly has He loved,
 And we must love Him, too,
 And trust in His redeeming blood,
 And try His works to do.</lyrics></song>
