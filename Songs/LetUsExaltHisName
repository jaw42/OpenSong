  <lyrics>[V1]
 At all times I will bless Him, 
 His praise will be in my mouth,
 My soul makes its boast in the Lord;||
 The humble man will hear of Him, 
 the afflicted will be glad
 And join with me to magnify the Lord.

[C]
 Let us exalt |His name together forever,
 I sought the Lord, He heard me 
 And delivered me from my fears;
 Let us exalt |His name together forever,
 O sing His praises magnify the Lord.

[V2]
 The angel of the Lord encamps 
 â€™round those who fear His name,
 To save them and deliver them from harm;
 Though lions roar with hunger,
 We lack for no good thing,
 No wonder then we praise Him |with our song.

[V3]
 Come children now and hear me
 if you would see long life,
 Just keep your lips from wickedness and lies;
 Do good and turn from evil, 
 seek peace instead of strife,
 Love righteousness and God will hear your cry.</lyrics></song>
