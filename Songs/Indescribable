.C#m                 Bsus/D#                      E  E2
 From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
.F#m             F#m7/E         D
 Creation's revealing Your majesty||
.C#m                 Bsus/D#                  E     E2
 From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
.F#m                          F#m7/E       D
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings
.A2    B
 All exclaiming...
 
 
[C]
.E             Bsus
 Indescribable, uncontainable,
.A2                                                   C#m
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
.         B      A2
 You are amazing God||
.E  E2        Bsus
 All powerful, untameable,
.A2                                             C#m
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
.        B       A2
 You are amazing God
 
[V2]
.C#m                               Bsus/D#         E E2
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
.F#m                   F#m7/E            D
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow||
.C#m                            Bsus/D        E    E2
 Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
.F#m                       F#m7/E            D
 Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
.A2       B
 None can fathom...
 
[T]
.E           Bsus
 Incomparable, unchangeable
.A2                                                 C#m
 You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same||
.         B      A2
 You are amazing God
.         B      A2
 You are amazing God</lyrics>
