 Abba Father
 Worthy is Your name
 Abba Father
 Worthy is Your name

[V1]
 Here we are
 Gathered together as a family
 Bound as one
 Lifting up our voices
 To the King of kings
 We cry||

[V2]
 Here we are
 Singing together as a family
 Bound as one
 Lifting up our voices
 To the King of kings
 We sing||

[C2]
 Abba Father
 Holy is Your name
 Abba Father
 Holy is Your name</lyrics></song>
