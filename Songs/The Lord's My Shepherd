  <lyrics>[v1]
 The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want;
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green; he leadeth me
 The quiet waters by.
 
[v2]
 My soul he doth restore again,
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness,
 E'en for his own name's sake.
 
[v3]
 Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
 Yet will I fear no ill:
 For thou art with me, and thy rod
 And staff me comfort still.
 
[v4]
 My table thou hast furnished
 In prsence of my foes;
 My head thou dost with oil anoint
 And my cup overflows.
 
[v5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me;
 And in God's house for evermore
 My dwelling-place shall be.</lyrics></song>
