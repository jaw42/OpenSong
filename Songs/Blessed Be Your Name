A                          E            D Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name [P] .A                E                F#m                  D Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise .A              E                F#m                  D And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say [V2]. Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me. When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name||. And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering . Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name [C].           A                     E  Blessed be the name of the Lord.                 F#m     D     Blessed be Your name.          A                E                   Blessed be the name of the Lord.            F#m             D Blessed be Your glorious name [B]. You give and take away. You give and take away. My heart will choose to say. Lord, blessed be Your name   </lyrics></song>
