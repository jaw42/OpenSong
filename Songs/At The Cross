  <lyrics>[v1]
 Oh Lord You've searched me,
 You know my way;
 Even when I fail You
 I know You love me
 
[v2]
 Your holy presence
 Surrounding me
 In every season,
 I know You love me
 I know You love me
 
[c1]
 At the cross I bow my knee
 Where Your blood was shed for me
 There's no greater love than this
[c2]
 You have overcome the grace
 Your glory fills the highest place
 What can seperate me now?
 
[v3]
 You go before me
 You shield my way
 Your hand upholds me
 I know You love me
 
[v4]
 And when the earth fades
 Falls from my eyes
 And you stand before me
 I know You love me
 I know You love me
 
[b]
 You tore the veil, You made a way
 When You said that it is done</lyrics></song>
