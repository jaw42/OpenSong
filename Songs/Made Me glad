  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                        A
 I will bless the Lord forever
.D                       A
 I will trust Him at all times
[V2]
.D                        A
 He has delivered me from all fear
.D                         A
 He has set my feet upon a rock
[V3]
.D
 I will not be moved
.    Bm              E
 And I'll say of the Lord
 
[C1]
.           A          Bm
 You are my shield, my strength
.   D          E
 My portion, deliverer
[C2]
.   A               Bm
 My shelter, strong tower
.   D            E               D
 My very present help in time of need
 
[V4]
 Whom have I in heaven but You
 There's none I desire beside You
[V5
 You have made me glad
 And I'll say of the Lord
 
.Bridge: Bm, C#m, D, E</lyrics></song>
