  <lyrics>[V1]
.C          Am7       F          C
 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart,
.G             Am7        F              G
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art;
.Fmaj7        Em7        C         F    G
 Thou my best thought by day or by night,
.C         Am7           F2          C
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
 
[V2]
.C          Am7        F            C
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word,
.G      Am7           F             G
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
.Fmaj7         Em7         C          F  G
 Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,
.C          Am7           F2          C
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
 
[V3]
.C        Am7           F           C
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
.G           Am7       F         G
 Thou mine Inheritance now and always;
.Fmaj7         Em7   C           F    G
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
.C            Am7        F2            C
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.
 
[V4]
.C            Am7       F       C
 High King of heaven my victory won,
.G           Am7            F                 G
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun;
.Fmaj7       Em7            C      F   G
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
.C           Am7       F2       C
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.</lyrics>
