 You are holy You are holy
 Jesus we lift up Your name
 We crown You the King
 We crown You the Lord of all

[V1]
 All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name
 Let angels prostrate fall
 Bring forth the royal diadem
 And crown Him Lord of all
 Bring forth the royal diadem
 And crown Him Lord of all||

[V2]
 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
 Ye ransomed from the fall
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace
 And crown Him Lord of all
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace
 And crown Him Lord of all||

[V3]
 Let ev'ry kindred ev'ry tribe
 On this terrestrial ball
 To Him all majesty ascribe
 And crown Him Lord of all
 To Him all majesty ascribe
 And crown Him Lord of all||
 And crown Him Lord of all

[T]
 You are holy You are holy
 Jesus we lift up Your name
 You are holy You are holy
 Jesus we lift up Your name
 You are holy You are holy
 Jesus we lift up Your name||</lyrics></song>
