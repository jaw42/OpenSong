  <lyrics>[C]
 Our heart our desire
 Is to see the nations worship
 Our cry our prayer
 Is to sing Your praise
 To the ends of the earth
 That with one mighty voice||
 Every tribe and tongue rejoices
 Our heart our desire
 Is to see the nations worship You

[V1]
 Heavenly Father Your mercy showers
 Down upon all people
 Every race upon this earth
 May Your Spirit pierce the darkness
 Break the chains of death upon us
 Let us rise in honest worship||
 To declare Your matchless worth

[V2]
 There is no power
 That for one hour
 Can withstand the greatness
 Of Your Word on tongues of faith
 So we're bold intercession
 Claiming all Your posessions||
 Praying now that every heart will bow
 Before You Lord in praise</lyrics></song>
