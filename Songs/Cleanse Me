  <lyrics>[V1]
 Search me O God
 And know my heart today
 Try me O Savior
 Know my thoughts I pray
 See if there be
 Some wicked way in me||
 Cleanse me from every sin
 And set me free

[V2]
 I praise Thee Lord
 For cleansing me from sin
 Fulfill Thy Word
 And make me pure within
 Fill me with fire
 Where once I burned with shame||
 Grant my desire
 To magnify Thy name

[V3]
 Lord take my life
 And make it wholly Thine
 Fill my poor heart
 With Thy great love divine
 Take all my will
 My passion self and pride||
 I now surrender Lord
 In me abide

[V4]
 O Holy Ghost
 Revival comes from Thee
 Send a revival
 Start the work in me
 Thy Word declares
 Thou wilt supply our need||
 For blessings now
 O Lord I humbly plead</lyrics></song>
