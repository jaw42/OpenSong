  <lyrics>[C]
 This is our God the Servant King
 He calls us now to follow Him
 To bring our lives as a daily offering
 Of worship to the Servant King

[V1]
 From heaven You came helpless babe
 Entered our world Your glory veiled
 Not to be served but to serve
 And give Your life that we might live

[V2]
 There in the garden of tears
 My heavy load He chose to bear
 His heart with sorrow was torn
 Yet not my will but Yours he said

[V3]
 Come see His hands and feet
 The scars that speak
 Of sacrifice
 Hands that flung stars
 Into space
 To cruel nails||
 Surrendered

[V4]
 So let us learn how to serve
 And in our lives enthrone Him
 Each other's needs to prefer
 For it is Christ we're serving</lyrics></song>
