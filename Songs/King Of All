  <lyrics>[V1]
.        B       C#m
 King of all the earth
.        A                E
 All the power is in Your Hand
.         B     C#m             A
 May Your glory cover the whole world
[V2]
.        B        C#m
 Give us faith to stand
.       A                  E
 And proclaim Your awesome splendour
.         B      C#m                A
 May this nation hear of Your great love
 
[C1]
.       B             C#m
 And if God is on our side
.     A           E
 Then who can be against us?
[C2]
.      B           C#m
 Every nation will bow 
.       A             E
 At the sound of Your Name
[C3]
 And if God is on our side
 Then who can be against us?
[C4]
 Every demon will flee
 In the power of Your Name
 
.C#m  A, C#m  B  A

.      C#m         A               E
 Every nation will bow and worship You

 Every tongue will confess that You are Lord</lyrics></song>
