;Verse 1
[V1]
.B              A                  D
 I will lift my hands and give You praise
.             E                    B
 Always stand strong and live Your way
[V2]
.                A                     D
 I've found Your grace now words can't say
.           E
 How much I love you Jesus
[V3]
.B                    A              D
 You're the one thing I cant live without
.           E                  B
 I stand on mountains high and shout
.          G              E
 You truly are the Son of God
 
;Chorus
[C1]
.       B                     A
 You're all I ever need and I live my live
.      E
 And I worship You, and I worship You
[C2]
.       B                     G
 You're all I ever need and I live my live
.      A                 E
 And I follow You, and I follow You

 All I ever need is Jesus Christ
