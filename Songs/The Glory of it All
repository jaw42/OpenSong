  <lyrics>[V1] 
 At the start
 he was there, he was there
 In the end,
 he’ll be there, he’ll be there
[P1] 
 And After all our hands have wrought
 He forgives
[C1] 
 Oh the Glory of it all is:
 He came here
 For the rescue of us all
 that we may live
 for the glory of it all
 for the glory of it all
[V2] 
 All is lost
 find him there, find him there
 After night
 Dawn is there, Dawn is there
[P2] 
 After all falls apart
 he repairs he repairs
[C2]
 Oh the Glory of it all is:
 He came here
 for the rescue of us all
 that we may live
 for the glory of it all|| 
 oh He is here
 for redemption from the fall
 that we may live
 for the glory of it all
 oh the glory of it all
 the glory of it all
 oh the glory of it all
[B] 
 After night
 comes the light
 dawn is here
 dawn is here
 it’s a new day
 it’s a new day||
 everything will change
 things will never be the same
 we will never be the same
 we will never be the same
 we will never be the same
 we will never be the same
[C3] 
 Oh, The glory of it all is
 you came here
 for the rescue of us all
 that we may live
 for the glory of it all||
 Oh you are here
 with redemption for us all
 that we may live
 for the glory of it all
 for the glory of it all
 oh the glory of it all
[T]
 we will never be the same</lyrics></song>
