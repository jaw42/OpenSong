  <lyrics>[V1]
.       G                      C
 When I call on Your name You answer
.       G                        C
 When I fall You are there by my side
[v2]
.      G               C
 You deliver me out of darkness
.      G                        C
 Now I stand in the hope of new life
 
[B]
.   Am
 By grace I'm free
.G/B C
 You rescue me
.Am      G/B C
 All I am is Yours
 
[C]
.G                                  C
 I found a love greater than life itself
.                                       Em
 I found a hope stronger and nothing compares
.                                  C
 I once was lost, now I'm alive in You
 
[V3]
 You're my God and my firm foundation
 It is You who'll trust at all times
[V4]
 I'll give glory and praise, adoration
 To my Saviour who is seated on high
 
.D  Em  C  G
[T1]
.D                  Em
 Love came down and rescued me
.C            G
 I thank you, yes I thank you
[T2]
.  D                  Em
 I once was blind but now I see
.C          G
 I see you, yes I see you</lyrics></song>
