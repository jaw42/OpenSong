  <lyrics>[V1]
.      D           G
 He is Lord, He is Lord
.      Em             A
 He is risen from the dead
.          Am  D
 And He is Lord.
[V2]
.      G         
 Every knee shall bow
.      C        Am
 Every tongue confess
.     G     D         C   G
 That Jesus Christ is Lord.
 
[V3]
 He's my Lord, He's my Lord
 He is risen from the dead
 And He's my Lord,
[V4]
 And my knee has bowed
 And my tongue confessed
 That Jesus Christ is Lord.</lyrics></song>
