  <lyrics>[C]
 Meet us here
 (Meet us here)
 Meet us here Lord
 (Meet us here Lord)
 We are few but we are strong
 When You surround us||
 Meet us here
 (Meet us here)
 Meet us here Lord
 (Meet us here Lord)
 As we gather in Your name
 Meet us here

[V1]
 Lord we have come to this house
 Where we love to sing Your praises
 We lift our hearts and our hands
 To the King of all the ages
 Hear us Lord we pray
 Come Jesus come
 Come fill this place</lyrics>
