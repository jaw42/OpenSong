.Bm     A    G           Bm A G
 I will love You for the cross
.Bm         A   G            Bm A G
 And I will love You for the cost
.A         G                     Bm A G
 Man of sufferings, bringer of my peace
[V2]
.Bm      A  G             Bm A  G
 You came into a world of shame,
.Bm           A  G               Bm  A  G
 And paid the price we could not pay
.A                     G
 Death that brought me life,
[V3]
.                      Bm A G  Bm A G
 Blood that brought me home 
.A                     G
 Death that brought me life,
.                      D  F#m
 Blood that brought me home
 
[C1]
.      Bm               G 
 And I love You for the cross,
.A                      G
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery
[C3]
.  Bm               G
 I love You for the cost,
.A                       G
 That Jesus you would do this for me
[D]
.     Bm               G
 When You were broken, You were beaten
.A                  G
 You were punished, I go free
.    Bm                G
 When You were wounded and rejected
.A              G     B A G
 In Your mercy, I am healed
 
[V4]
 Jesus Christ the sinner's friend
 Does this kindness know no bounds
[V5]
 With Your precious blood,
 You have purchased me
[V6]
 O the mystery of the cross,
 You were punished You were crushed
[V7]
 But that the punishment has become my peace
 Yes that punishment has become my peace</lyrics></song>
