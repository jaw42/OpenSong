.D        Em   G
 Come let us return unto the Lord
.D      Em          G
 Let us call on the power of His name
.D      Em    G
 Let us bow before the throne of grace
[V2]
.D      Em               G
 And confess that we are hungry again
.Em   D/F#         G  
 Come on and let's worship
.Em            D/F#       G         A
 Let's tell the Lord that we are in need
 
[C1]
.D 
 I'm still thirsty
.G
 I'm still seeking
.        Bm                                   G
 There's gotta be more gotta be more gotta be more
[C2]
.D
 I'm still standing
.G
 I'm receiving
.        Bm                                   G
 There's gotta be more gotta be more gotta be more
 
 
[V3]
 Let the power of healing fall upon me
 Deliver me and set me free
[V4]
 Wipe away all the tears and sadness
 Then we'll all stand whole in Your glory
[V5]
 Come on and let's worship
 Let's tell the Lord that we are in need</lyrics></song>
