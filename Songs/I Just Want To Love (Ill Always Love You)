  <lyrics>[V1]
.G              D
 I just want to love
.Em             C
 I just want to sing
.G           D
 To the One above
[V2]
.        Em                   C
 Who has touched this thirsty soul
 (repeat)
.             A 
 And now I'll never be the same
 
[C1]
.G           D
 I'll always love You
.Em          C              G
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus
[C2]
.          D
 I long to worship You
.   Em            C
 In spirit and in truth
 
[V3]
 Everyday I'll come
 Spend my life with You
[V4]
 Learning of Your heart
 And what You're calling me to do
 (Repeat)
[V5]
 My every breath belongs to You
[V6]
[B]
.Am            Em 
 And with this song
.               C               Am 
 We'll lift the name of Jesus higher
[V]
.           Em 
 And with a shout 
.                   C
 We'll raise up one voice
