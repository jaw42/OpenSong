  <lyrics>[V1]
 It's Your blood that cleanses me
 It's Your blood that gives me life
 It's Your blood that took my place
 In redeeming sacrifice
 Washes me whiter than the snow
 Than the snow
 My Jesus, God's precious sacrifice
 
[V2]
 It's the blood of the Lamb
 It's the blood of the Lamb
 It's the blood of the Lamb
 That can cleanse the deepest stain
 Washes me whiter than the snow
 Than the snow
 My Jesus, God's precious sacrifice</lyrics>
