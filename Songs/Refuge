.G           C     D       G
 God is our Refuge and our Strength

 An ever-present help
. C        D           G
 Therefore I shall not fear
[V2]
.           C           D       G                      
 Though the earth gives way and mountains fall
.           C      D           G         D 
 Though its waters rise and my world may shake, 
 
[C1]

 Our God is the Shelter in the storm

 Our God is the One who won’t let go
[C2]

 Our God, He remains the same
.                          C       D     G
 Yesterday, today, forever He will never change
 
[V3]
 God of great wisdom and of love
 My times are in Your hands
 You’re the Hope on which I stand

 Though the earth gives way and mountains fall
 Though its waters rise and my world may shake,

 Of turning with You </lyrics></song>
