[V1]
.G               D/F#
 Before the day, before the light
.Em7                                  C
 Before the world revolved around the sun
.G                         D/F#
 God on High, stepped down into time
.              Em7                        C  D
 and wrote the story of His Love for everyone
 
[P]
.Am7               D
 He has filled our hearts with wonder
.Am7          C      D
 So that we always remember
 
[C]
.G
 You and I are made to worship
.C
 You and I are called to love
.Am7                        Dsus4  D
 You and I are forgiven and free
 
.G
 When you and I embrace surrender
.     C
 When you and I choose to believe
.     Am7            Dsus4
 Then you and I will see
.                     G  C  G  C
 Who we were meant to be

[V2]
.G              D/F#
 All we are and all we have
.Em7                            Dsus
 Is all a gift from God that we receive
.G                        D/F#
 Brought to life, we open up our eyes
.           Em7                      C   D
 To see the majesty and glory of the King
 
 
[B]
.Am7                G
 Even the rocks cry out
.                 C
 Even the heavens shout
.                    Am7  D
 At the sound of His Holy Name
.Am7                     G
 So let every voice sing out
.                       C
 And let every knee bow down
.                Am7     D
 He is worthy of all our praise</lyrics>
