[V1]
.D                        G   D
 Come, now is the time to worship
.A                        Em        G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart
[V2]
.D                        G   D
 Come, just as you are to worship
.A                       Em        G
 Come, just as you are before your God
.D
 Come...
 
;Chorus 
[C1]
.G                            D
 One day every tongue will confess You as God
.G                       D
 One day every knee will bow
[C2]
.G                             Bm
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
.    Em                A
 Who gladly choose You now</lyrics></song>
