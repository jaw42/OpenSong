  <lyrics>[C]
 For by Your hand
 We have been fed
 And by Your Spirit
 We have been led

[V1]
 O Lord You have been good
 You have been faithful
 To all generations
 O Lord Your steadfast love
 And tender mercy
 Have been our salvation||

[V2]
 O Lord Almighty God
 Father unchanging
 Upright and holy
 O Lord You have been good
 You have been faithful
 You have been good||</lyrics></song>
