  <lyrics>[V1]
.  E                    A        B
 O worship the King all glorious above
.  E                   B         E
 O gratefully sing His wonderful love
.    B7
 Our Shield and Defender the Ancient of Days
.  E                        B7          E
 Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise

[V2]
.  E                   A           B
 O tell of His might O sing of His grace
.      E                     B      E
 Whose robe is the light and canopy space
.    B7
 His chariots of wrath
.         B7
 The deep thunderclouds form
.    E                       B7           E
 And dark is His path on the wings of the storm

.A2                C#m7
 You alone are the matchless King
.   F#m7             E/G#
 To You alone be all majesty
.     A2
 Your glories and wonders
.     C#m7
 What tongue can recite||
.    F#m7              E/G#
 You breathe in the air
.    E/G#            A2
 You shine in the light

[V3]
.  E                   A       B
 O measureless might ineffable love
.      E                 B        E
 While angels delight to worship above
.    B7
 Thy mercies how tender how firm to the end
.    E                B7         E
 Our Maker Defender Redeemer and Friend</lyrics>
