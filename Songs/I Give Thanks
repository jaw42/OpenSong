  <lyrics>[C1]
 I will arise and give thanks
 To You Lord my God
 And Your name I will bless
 With my whole heart
 You have shown mercy
 You have shown mercy to me
 I give thanks to You Lord

[C2]
 We will arise and give thanks
 To You Lord our God
 And Your name we will bless
 With our whole hearts
 You have shown mercy
 You have shown mercy to us
 We give thanks to You Lord

[V1]
 You have shown me favor unending
 You have given Your life for me
 And my heart |knows of Your goodness
 Your blood has covered me

[V2]
 You have poured out
 Your healing upon us
 You have set the captives free
 And we know it's not
 What we've done
 But by Your hand alone

[B]
 You O Lord are the
 Healer of my soul
 You oh Lord are the
 Gracious Redeemer
 You come to restore us again
 Yes You come to restore
 Us again... and again

[T]
 I give thanks to You Lord
 I give thanks to You Lord</lyrics>
