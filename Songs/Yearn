  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 holy design
 this place in time
 that i might seek and find my God
 my God
[C]
 Lord i want to yearn for You
 i want to burn with passion
 over You and only You
 Lord i want to yearn
[V2]
 Your joy is mine
 yet why am i fine
 with all my singing and bringing grain
 in light of Him
 
[V3]
 oh You give life and breath
 through Him You give all things
 in Him we live and move
 that's why i sing
