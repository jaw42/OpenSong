  <lyrics>[V1]
.    A                 Bm       C#m               D
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
.  A               Bm    
 I can't deny what You have shown 
.    C#m               D
 The cross speaks of a God of love
[V2]
.E                   D
 There displayed for all to see
.C#m               D
 Jesus Christ, our only hope
[V3]
.  E              D
 A message of the Father's heart
.C#m               B               
 Come my children, come on home
 
[C1]
.     A           D            A        E
   As high as the heavens are above the earth
.     A           D          A          E
   So high is the measure of Your great love
[C2]
.     A          D       A        E
   As far as the east is from the west
.     A             D         A         E
   So far as You've taken our sins from us
 
[V4] 
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
 I never recognised Your touch
 Until I met You at the cross
[V5]
 We are fallen dust to dust
 How could You do this for us
[V6]
 Son of God shed precious blood
 Who can comprehend this love
 
[B1]
.D                            
 How high, how wide, how deep 
.F#m
 How high, how wide, how deep
[B2]
 How high, how wide, how deep
.G             A  D  A  E    x4
 How high!   </lyrics></song>
