  <lyrics>[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of Glory died
 My richest gain I count but loss
 And pour contempt on all my pride

[V2]
 Forbid it Lord that I should boast
 Save in the death of Christ my God
 All the vain things that charm me most
 I sacrifice them to His blood

[V3]
 See from His head His hands His feet
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown

[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
 That were a present far too small
 Love so amazing so divine
 Demands my soul my life my all</lyrics></song>
