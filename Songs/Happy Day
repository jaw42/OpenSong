.C                            
 The greatest day in history
.F                                Am
 Death is beaten You have rescued me
.                     F
 Sing it out Jesus is alive
[V2]
.C
 The empty cross, The empty grave
.F
 Life eternal You have won the day
[V3]
.Am                    F
 Shout it out, 'Jesus is alive!'
.        G
 He's alive!
 
[C1]
.C        F          Am
 Oh happy day, happy day
.                  G
 You washed my sin away
.C        F          Am
 Oh happy day, happy day
[C2]
.     G             C   F  Am
 I'll never be the same
. G                C/E  F  Am  G
 Forever I am changed
 
[V4]
 When I stand, in that place
 Free at last, meeting face to face
 I am Yours, Jesus You are mine
[V5]
 Endless joy, perfect peace
 Earthly pain finally will cease
[V6]
 Celebrate Jesus is alive!
 He's alive!

.Am                 Em
 Oh what a glorious day
.              F
 What a glorious way
.    C
 That You have saved me
[T2]
.Am                 Em
 Oh what a glorious day
.                F   C
 What a glorious name</lyrics></song>
