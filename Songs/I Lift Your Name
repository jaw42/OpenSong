  <lyrics>[C]
 I lift Your name
 Your holy name Jehovah God
 Elohim the great I Am
 The risen Lamb
 My Comforter and King

[V1]
 Lord my heart can grow
 So far away and cold
 And yet for me
 Your love is still the same
 Lord I bend my knee
 In awe and fear of Thee||
 My head bowed down
 In rev'rence to Your name

[V2]
 Lord my heart's desire
 Is to be filled with Spirit fire
 My purpose is to worship You alone
 Open up my soul to worship and adore
 To be a fragrance
 Offered to Your throne||</lyrics></song>
