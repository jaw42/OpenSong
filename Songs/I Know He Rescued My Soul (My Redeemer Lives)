.E           A  
 I know He rescued my soul
.E         A     
 His blood covered my sin

 I believe, I believe

 My shame, He's taken away
 My pain, is healed in His name
 I believe, I believe
 
[C1]

 I'll raise a banner

 Cause my Lord has conquered the grave

 You lift my burden and I rise with You

 To see Your kingdom come</lyrics></song>
