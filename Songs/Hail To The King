  <lyrics>[C]
 Hail to the King
 In all His splendor
 And majesty
 Hail to the King of kings
 Lord Jesus our God

[V1]
 You came to us a man
 In very nature God
 Pierced for our iniquities
 As You hung upon the cross
 But God exalted You
 To the highest place||
 And gave to You
 The right to bear
 The Name Above All Names
 That at the name of Jesus
 We should bow
 Ev'ry tongue confess||
 That You are Lord
 And when You come in glory
 For the world to see
 We will sing

[V2]
 We eagerly await
 The coming of the day
 The glory of the risen King
 Will shine upon the earth
 Then rival thrones will fall
 Before the Lord of all||
 And hail supreme authority
 In the true and living God
 At the name of Jesus
 We will bow
 As ev'ry tongue confesses
 You as Lord||
 And when You come in glory
 For the world to see
 We will sing</lyrics></song>
