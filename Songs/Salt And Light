  <lyrics>[V1]
 You make me want to be like You
 Your holiness I will pursue
 I want the heart of Jesus
 Show me the meaning of Your grace
 I want to give the world a taste
 Of the love of Jesus||

[C]
 Make me salt make me light
 Let holy fire ignite
 Reveal Your glory in my life
 I am not ashamed to lift up Your holy name
 Make me salt make me light

[B]
 Set me as a city on a hill a lamp upon a stand
 Mold me in Your image the work of Your hand</lyrics></song>
