  <lyrics>[C]
 Christ in me is to live
 To die is to gain
 Christ in me is to live
 To die is to gain

[V1]
 He's my King, He's my song.
 He's my life, He's my joy.
 He's my strength, He's my sword.
 He's my peace, He's my Lord.

[V2]
 When I look to the stars and the space 
 I can see, I can see 
 His beautiful face
 For the world, for every boy and girl.

[V3]
 As I touch my eyes, 
 I can see that I'm starting to cry
 And I ask why, why You had to die.
 As I touch my eyes, 
 I can see that I'm starting to cry
 And I ask why, why You had to die.</lyrics>
