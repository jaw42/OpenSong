  <lyrics>[C]
 O love of God how rich and pure
 How measureless and strong
 It shall forevermore endure
 The saints' and angels' song
 
[V1]
 The love of God is greater far
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell
 It goes beyond the highest star
 And reaches to the lowest hell||
 The guilty pair bowed down with care
 God gave His Son to win
 His erring child He reconciled
 And pardoned from his sin
 
[V2]
 When years of time shall pass away
 And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
 When men who here refuse to pray
 On rocks and hills and mountains call||
 God's love so sure shall still endure
 All measureless and strong
 Redeeming grace to Adam's race
 The saints' and angels' song
 
[V3]
 Could we with ink the ocean fill
 And were the skies of parchment made
 Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill
 And ev'ry man a scribe by trade||
 To write the love of God above
 Would drain the ocean dry
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole
 Tho' stretched from sky to sky</lyrics>
