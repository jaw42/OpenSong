  <lyrics>[V1]
.G      D       Em
 Lord I come to You
.                Bm         Em
 Let my heart be changed, renewed
.        D        C
 Flowing from the grace
[V2]
.          D       Em C  D
 That I've found in You
.G             D       Em
 And Lord I've come to know
.                 Bm     Em
 The weaknesses I see in me
[V3]
.        D        C  D
 Will be stripped away
.                     C  G  F
 By the power of Your love
 
[C1]
.C Em    D                    C        G  D/F#
 Hold me close, let Your love surround me
.C  Em    D                     G C G F
 Bring me near, draw me to Your side
.    C Em D                           C  G
 And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle
[C2]
.    G     D/F#       Em
 And I will soar with You
.            D        C
 Your spirit leads me on
.       D             C  G  D
 In the power of Your love
 
[V4]
 Lord unveil my eyes
 Let me see You face to face
 The knowledge of Your love
[V5]
 As You live in me
 Lord renew my mind
[V6]
 As Your will unfolds in my life
 In living every day
 By the power of Your love</lyrics></song>
