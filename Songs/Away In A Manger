  <lyrics>[V1]
 Away in a manger no crib for a bed
 The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
 The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

[V2]
 The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
 But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
 I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
 And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

[V3]
 Be near me Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever and love me I pray
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
 And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there</lyrics>
