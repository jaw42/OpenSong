  <lyrics>[V1]
 Befriended, befriended
 by the King above all kings
 Surrendered, surrendered,
 to the Friend above all friends.

[V2]
 Invited, invited
 deep into this mystery.
 Delighted, delighted
 by the wonders I have seen.

[C]
 This will be my story,
 This will be my song.
 You'll always be my Savior, Jesus
 You will always have my heart.

[V3]
 Astounded, astounded
 that Your Gospel beckoned me
 Surrounded, surrounded
 but I've never been so free.

[V4] 
 Determined, determined
 now to live this life for You
 You're so worthy
 my greatest gift would be the least You're due.</lyrics></song>
