  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are Lord and King
 Master of everything
 All of creation speaks
 Of Your glory||
 You are Lord and King
 Master of everything
 All of creation speaks
 Of Your glory
 Now I dance with joy...
 
[C]
 Your love has changed my life
 I no longer live in despair
 Knowing You're everywhere
 Love has changed my life
 And You've given me a reason
 To celebrate
 
[T]
 Your love has changed my life
 Your love has changed my life</lyrics>
