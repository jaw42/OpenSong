  <lyrics>[V1]
 O come all ye faithful
 Joyful and triumphant
 O come ye O come ye to Bethlehem
 Come and behold Him
 Born the king of angels
 O come let us adore Him||
 O come let us adore Him
 O come let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord

[V2]
 Sing choirs of angels sing in exultation
 Sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
 Glory to God in the highest
 O come let us adore Him
 O come let us adore Him
 O come let us adore Him||
 Christ the Lord

[V3]
 Yea Lord we greet Thee
 Born this happy morning
 Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n
 Word of the Father
 Now in flesh appearing
 O come let us adore Him||
 O come let us adore Him
 O come let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord

[T]
 O come let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord
 Christ the Lord</lyrics></song>
