  <lyrics>[V1] 
.D         Em     A7         D
 God is so good,  God is so good;
.D         G     Em      D    A7 D    (B to E)
 God is so good, Heâ€™s so good to me.

[V2]
 He cares for me, He cares for me;
 He cares for me, He's so good to me.

[V3]
 I'll do His will, I'll do His will;
 I'll do His will, He's so good to me.

[V4]
 He loves me so, He loves me so;
 He loves me so, He's so good to me.

[V5]
 Jesus is real, Jesus is real;
 Jesus is real, He's so good to me.

[V6]
 I love Him so, I love Him so;
 I love Him so, He's so good to me.

[V7]
.E          F#m     B7         E
 He answers prayer, He answers prayer;
.E          A       F#m     E    B7 E
 He answers prayer, He's so good to me.</lyrics></song>
