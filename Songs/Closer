  <lyrics>[V]
.
 Beautiful are the words spoken to me
.
 Beautiful is the One who is speaking
 
[C]
.
 Come in close, come in close and speak
.
 Come in close, come closer to me
 
[B]
.
 The power of Your words
.
 are filled with grace and mercy
.
 Let them fall on my ears
.
 and break my stony heart</lyrics></song>
