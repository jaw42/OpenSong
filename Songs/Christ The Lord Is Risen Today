 Christ the Lord is ris'n today| Alleluia
 Sons of men and angels say| Alleluia
 Raise your joys and triumphs high| Alleluia
 Sing ye heavens and earth reply| Alleluia
 
[V2]
 Lives again our glorious King| Alleluia
 Where O death is now thy sting| Alleluia
 Dying once He all doth save| Alleluia
 Where thy victory O grave| Alleluia

 Love's redeeming work is done| Alleluia
 Fought the fight the battle won| Alleluia
 Death in vain forbids Him rise| Alleluia
 Christ has opened paradise| Alleluia

 Soar we now where Christ has led| Alleluia
 Following our exalted Head| Alleluia
 Made like Him like Him we rise| Alleluia
 Ours the cross the grave the skies| Alleluia

 Vain the stone the watch the seal| Alleluia
 Christ hath burst the gates of hell| Alleluia
 Death in vain forbids His rise| Alleluia
 Christ hath opened paradise| Alleluia
