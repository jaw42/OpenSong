  <lyrics>[C]
 All blessing and honor are His
 All glory and power are His
 Let all wisdom and strength
 Be the Lord's in this place
 Let all glory be given to Him

[V1]
 There is joy in the Lord
 There is love in His Spirit
 There is hope in the knowledge of Him
 There's a fountain that flows
 Like a river from heaven
 Abounding in love to my soul||

[V2]
 There is joy in the Lord
 There is love in His Spirit
 There is hope in the knowledge of Him
 There's a fountain I know
 Ev'ry time I am near it
 My heart overflows to the Lord||</lyrics></song>
