  <lyrics>[V1]
 Before the throne of God above
 I have a strong and perfect plea
 A great High Priest whose name is Love
 Who ever lives and pleads for me
 My name is graven on His hands
 My name is written on His heart||
 I know that while in heaven He stands
 No tongue can bid me thence depart
 No tongue can bid me thence depart

[V2]
 When Satan tempts me to despair
 And tells me of the guilt within
 Upward I look and see Him there
 Who made an end of all my sin
 Because the sinless Savior died
 My sinful soul is counted free||
 For God the Just is satisfied
 To look on Him and pardon me
 To look on Him and pardon me

[V3]
 Behold Him there the risen Lamb
 My perfect spotless Righteousness
 The great unchangeable I Am
 The King of glory and of grace
 One with Himself I cannot die
 My soul is purchased by His blood||
 My life is hid with Christ on high
 With Christ my Savior and my God
 With Christ my Savior and my God

[V4]
 I bow before the cross of Christ
 And marvel at this love divine
 God's perfect Son was sacrificed
 To make me righteous in God's eyes
 This river's depths I cannot know
 But I can glory in its flood||
 The Lord Most High has bowed down low
 And poured on me His glorious love
 And poured on me His glorious love</lyrics>
