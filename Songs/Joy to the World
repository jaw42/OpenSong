The Lord is come.. Let earth receive her King.. Let every heart prepare Him room,. And heav'n and nature sing,. And heav'n and nature sing,. And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing. [V2]. Joy to the world!  The Savior reigns;. Let men their songs emply.. While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains. Repeat the sounding joy,. Repeat the sounding joy,. Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. [V3]. He rules the world with truth and grace,. And makes the nations prove. The glories of His righteousness,. And wonders of His love,. And wonders of His love,. And wonders, wonders of His love. </lyrics></song>
