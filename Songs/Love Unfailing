.Em     C        G   D         Em  C
 Love unfailing, overtaking my heart
.    G       D
 You take me in
[V2]
.Em      C    
 Finding peace again
.G       D               C
 Fear is lost in all You are
 
[V3]
.    D                                   Em
 And I would give the world to tell Your story
.                          C  
 'Cause I know that You've called me
.                   G
 I know that You've called me
[V4]
.     D                                C
 I've lost myself for good within Your promise
.            Em
 And I won't hide it
.                C
 I won't hide it
 
[C]
.G                           D
 Jesus I believe in You, and I would go
.       Am
 To the ends of the earth
.       C
 To the ends of the earth
[D1]
.    G 
 For You alone are the Son of God
.    F
 And all the world will see
[D2]
.             Am
 That You are God
.             C     Em  C  G
 That You are God</lyrics></song>
