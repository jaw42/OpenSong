  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                          Em 
 Over the mountains and the sea
.                              G 
 Your river runs with love for me
.                      A 
 And I will open up my heart
[V2]
.                          D
 And let the healer set me free
.                       Em 
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.                         G 
 And I will daily lift my hands
[V3]
.       
 For I will always sing
.   A                   
 Of when Your love came down
 
[C1]
.D                   Em 
 I will sing of Your love forever
.G                   A          D
 I will sing of Your love forever
[C2]
.                    Em         G 
 I will sing of Your love forever
.                    A
 I will sing of Your love forever
 
[B1]
.Em             D        
 Oh I feel like dancing
.G                  A
 It's foolishness I know
[B3]
.Em                     D
 But when the world has seen the light
.          G 
 They will dance with joy 
.           A
 Like we're dancing now</lyrics></song>
