  <lyrics>[C1]
 We're knocking
 Knocking on the door of heaven
 We're crying
 Crying for this generation
 We're praying for Your name
 To be known in all of the earth

 
[C2]
 We're watching
 Watching on the walls to see You
 We're looking
 Looking for a time of breakthrough
 We're praying for Your word
 To bear fruit in all of the earth
 In all of the earth

[V1]
 We will give ourselves no rest
 Till Your kingdom comes on earth
 You've positioned watchmen on the walls
 
[V2]
 Now our prayers will flow like tears
 For You've shared Your heart with us
 God of heaven
 On our knees we fall
 
[T]
 Come down in power
 Reveal Your heart again
 Come hear our cries
 The tears that plead for rain</lyrics>
