.A    F#m          E        D
 God above all the world in motion
.A    F#m         E         D
 God above all my hopes and fears
[V2]
.A           F#m           E            D     Bm 
 And I don't care what the world throws at me now

 It's gonna be alright
 
[V3]
 Hear the sound of the generations
 Making loud our freedom song
[V4]
 All in all that the world would know Your name
 We're gonna be alright
